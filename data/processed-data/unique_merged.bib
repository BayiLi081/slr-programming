AB  - Resilience appears to have become a buzz word since the ecological, psychological, social and economic sciences began to use it to refer, respectively, to the capacity of ecosystems, people, societies, the economy, and more recently even urban systems to cope with disturbance. In fact, it is unclear exactly what the catchword ``resilient city{'' means. Based on these assumptions, this article reviews resilience perspectives and their possible application to urban systems. In the first part of the paper, the concept of resilience, its evolution and perspectives (from engineering to social ecology) are analyzed with reference to ecosystems, societies and complex systems. In the second part we try to shed light on this panacea of concepts applied to cities. Important insights of this review are that certain resilience engineering perspectives (such as recovery and persistence views) can lead to unsustainable patterns of development in cities, while from complex systems resilience perspectives the principles of sustainability and transformability emerge as the consequent and necessary trajectory. While the term ``resilient cities{''} often refers only to the capacity to maintain functions and structures, we argue that urban resilience should be framed within the resilience (system persistence), transition (system incremental change) and transformation (system reconfiguration) views.

AB  - The global environmental situation is in decline, and cities are at the very centre of the problem. This has resulted in an urgent need for a radical and large-scale eco-technological overhaul. This chapter focuses on the paradigm shift towards sustainability and resilience, and particularly, how the new thinking of resilience can convert investments in urban infrastructure and development into resilient support systems, enabling both greater city prosperity and environmental regeneration. The objectives of this chapter are to search for new paths in the creation of resilient communities through the sustainable use of technologies; to discuss the significance of equity, economy, and traditional knowledge in resilient cities; to put forward a green approach that encompasses both mitigation and adaptation; and to explore potential and practical ways of creating urban resilience. A detailed review of existing definitions and policies related to urban resilience, as well as the role of eco-technologies and city planners in this process, is also presented. The chapter concludes by suggesting a set of urban design strategies and a list of key stakeholders as critical ingredients in the move towards urban resilience.

AB  - River cities require a management approach based on resilience to floods rather than on resistance. Resisting floods by means of levees, dams, and channelization neglects inherent uncertainties arising from human-nature couplings and fails to address the extreme events that are expected to increase with climate change, and is thereby not a reliable approach to long-term flood safety. By applying resilience theory to address system persistence through changes, I develop a theory on ``urban resilience to floods{''} as an alternative framework for urban flood hazard management. Urban resilience to floods is defined as a city's capacity to tolerate flooding and to reorganize should physical damage and socioeconomic disruption occur, so as to prevent deaths and injuries and maintain current socioeconomic identity. It derives from living with periodic floods as learning opportunities to prepare the city for extreme ones. The theory of urban resilience to floods challenges the conventional wisdom that cities cannot live without flood control, which in effect erodes resilience. To operationalize the theory for planning practice, a surrogate measure-the percent floodable area-is developed for assessing urban resilience to floods. To enable natural floodplain functions to build urban resilience to floods, flood adaptation is advocated in order to replace flood control for mitigating flood hazards.

AB  - In Europe, river floods have been increasing in frequency and severity. These circumstances require the management of flood risk by integrating new concepts like urban resilience. Nevertheless, urban resilience seems to have no accurate meanings. That is why researchers are primarily concerned with defining resilience. Nevertheless, focus on research object seems to be more important than focus on conceptual debate (Resilience of what? Rather than what is resilience?). Thus the methodology designed here is focused on urban considerations. In fact, a system approach emphasizes technical networks' importance concerning urban resilience. Principles and assumptions applied in this research finally lead to the analysis of how urban networks are able to face natural hazards. In this context, a Web-GIS has been developed for analyzing resistance capacity, absorption capacity and recovery capacity of different technical networks. A first application has been carried out on a French agglomeration in order to analyze road network absorption capacity. This application is very specific but, thanks to this example, it is already possible to highlight the methodology's usefulness. © Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Urban complexity is a hard-to-grasp concept. This paper firstly aims at investigating this issue through the prism of scale-hierarchic distributions: fractals, power laws, Zipf's laws and Pareto distributions. Authors notably emphasize the mathematical proximity between these distributions. Building on the convergence of Prigogine's dissipative structure theory, industrial ecology and Bejan's constructal law, authors then stress the crucial role that power law distributed complex urban structures have to play to make cities energy efficient and resilient.

AB  - Recent changes in cities and their environments, caused by rapid urbanisation and climate change, have increased both flood probability and the severity of flooding. Consequently, there is a need for all cities to adapt to climate and socio-economic changes by developing new strategies for flood risk management. Following a risk paradigm shift from traditional to more integrated approaches, and considering the uncertainties of future urban development, one of the main emerging tasks for city managers becomes the development of resilient cities. However, the meaning of the resilience concept and its operability is still not clear. The goal of this research is to study how urban engineering and design disciplines can improve resilience to floods in urban neighbourhoods. This paper presents the conceptual Spatial Decision Support System (DS3) model which we consider a relevant tool to analyse and then implement resilience into neighbourhood design. Using this model, we analyse and discuss alternative stormwater management options at the neighbourhood scale in two specific areas: Rotterdam and New Orleans. The results obtained demonstrate that the DS3 model confirmed in its framework analysis that stormwater management systems can positively contribute to the improved flood resilience of a neighbourhood. © IWA Publishing 2013.

AB  - Looking at the programme and the range of conferences in spatial planning around Europe in recent years, resilience seems to be the new buzzword in urban-regional matters. As such it is following sustainability, sometimes even used interchangeably. It is argued that, with a sound theoretical framework for an urban regional context still pending, it is difficult to apply resilience as a new paradigm to planning practice. Based on conceptual thoughts on resilience particularly in relation to the concept of sustainability, this contribution suggests that one challenge for urban regional resilience is the need for intensified collaboration between different disciplines as well as between science and practice. It concludes with suggestions on how to approach this challenge using existing platforms such as conferences or collaborative projects. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper considers issues of urban design and urban resilience in the wake of disaster, with special reference to the trauma inflicted on New Orleans, USA by Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005. Based on a variety of historical examples, it argues that cities are remarkably resilience entities, and have survived and even flourished in the aftermath of horrific destruction, whether caused by human action, natural catastrophe or a combination thereof. The paper reviews historical cases of urban disaster in order to isolate important design and planning factors influencing the capacity of a city to rebound and recover. These include London Fire, 1666; the Great Fire of Chicago, 1871; Great Tangshan Earthquake, 1976; and the Mexico City Earthquake of 1985. It then focuses on the key role of a resourceful citizenry in determining post-disaster resilience. Hurricane Katrina not only devastated the built environment of New Orleans but, by forcing a mass evacuation of residents, tore apart its social fabric as well. Plans to rebuild the city's physical infrastructure have lagged in part because the social fabric and communal networks have yet to recover. Only with strong citizen involvement at the grassroots level will the rebuilding of New Orleans yield a robust and inclusive metropolis, rather than a theme-park shadow of its former self.

AB  - In France, as in the rest of Europe, river floods have been increasing in frequency and severity, there are more and more instances of rivers bursting their banks, aggravating the impact of the flooding of areas supposedly protected by flood defenses. These circumstances oblige us to manage flood risk by integrating new concepts like urban resilience design. Definitively, our goal is to reduce flood risk by managing vulnerability issues of flooded areas to achieve flood resilient cities. A first analysis of city needs of decision-making tools showed that no tools to prioritize recovery actions are available. This tool needs to integrate some models and indicators to be efficient: an urban systemic model of the city; resilience indicators; failure and recovery scenarios. A first prototype sketch was designed but it needs to integrate these models and indicators. That is why, as part of a future PhD thesis, this tool will be developed to be used directly by decision makers and communities. © 2010 WIT Press.

AB  - Cities are complex and interdependent systems, extremely vulnerable to threats from both natural hazards and terrorism. This paper proposes a comprehensive strategy of urban hazard mitigation aimed at the creation of resilient cities, able to withstand both types of threats. The paper reviews hazard mitigation practice, defines a resilient city, considers the relationship between resilience and terrorism, and discusses why resilience is important and how to apply its principles to physical and social elements of cities. Contending that current hazard mitigation policy, practice, and knowledge fail to deal with the unique aspects of cities under stress, the paper recommends a major resilient cities initiative, including expanded urban systems research, education and training, and increased collaboration among professional groups involved in city building and hazard mitigation.

AB  - By 2050 two-thirds of the world's population will live in urban areas (UN Habitat, 2006). As a result the dramatic urbanisation process is depleting the world's resources and the chief culprit behind climate change. Resilient cities can adapt to changes, grand challenges and can balance ecosystem and human functions. Spatial planning aims at making cities more resilient and sustainable which requires innovation, foresight, effective partnership and networks among all actors involved in urban planning processes. In practice, the implementation of these ideas is difficult because cities are dynamic structures and spatial planning processes as well as their outputs are very diverse across Europe and the world. Harmonised spatial planning information and spatial data infrastructures (SDI) encourage monitoring and more transparent planning processes. SDI can be a supportive element for spatial planning processes as it provides important harmonised data input and helps to better understand the complexity of cities and planning.

AB  - This article discusses the post-disaster urban resilience design framework in the case of post-disaster urban reconstruction in Sichuan after the Great Sichuan Earthquake (also known as the Wenchuan Earthquake) in May 2008 in China. The focus is on three main aspects of post-disaster urban reconstruction: sociospatial coherence, temporal continuity, and multistakeholder integration and communication. Critical interpretation of the government-guided reconstruction reveals that reconstruction was limited to the generic production and implementation of top-down planning. From the perspective of urban resilience, and through an alternative design scenario developed in this research, this article highlights an urban resilience design framework based on postdisaster development in the Sichuan city of Dujiangyan. By identifying the deficiencies of the governmental reconstruction where in many aspects resilience has not been considered, and by proposing the alternative where resilience has been considered to develop a better living, this research seeks to integrate urban resilience as a key aspect in the Sichuan reconstruction and as essential for developing the postdisaster city towards a more coherent, sustainable, and integral urban future.

AB  - Australian cities currently face high levels of oil vulnerability, which is often unevenly distributed, particularly within the middle and outer suburbs of the greater metropolitan areas (Dodson and Sipe, 2006). New urban policies and planning practices are needed to avoid, remedy or mitigate the impacts of oil price rises and create urban resilience (Newman et al. 2009). Whilst the lack of scholarship around oil vulnerability is slowly beginning to be addressed within the Australian urban planning context, an emphasis on the links between urban governance and urban resilience is still largely marginalised despite its acknowledged central role in the quest of urban resilience. Our main point of departure is the re-conceptualisation of oil vulnerability as a planning and governance deficit within Australian cities. We identify a number of gaps that combine to inhibit the capacity for the development of urban resilience in the face of oil vulnerability and depletion scenarios. © 2010 Planning Institute Australia.

AB  - There is a growing recognition of the need for daily contact with nature, to live happy, productive, meaningful lives. Recent attention to biophilic design among architects and designers acknowledges this power of nature. However, in an increasingly urban planet, more attention needs to be aimed at the urban scales, at planning for and moving towards what the authors call. biophilic cities.. Biophilic cities are cities that provide close and daily contact with nature, nearby nature, but also seek to foster an awareness of and caring for this nature. Biophilic cities, it is argued here, are also sustainable and resilient cities. Achieving the conditions of a biophilic city will go far in helping to foster social and landscape resilience, in the face of climate change, natural disasters and economic uncertainty and various other shocks that cities will face in the future. The paper identifies key pathways by which biophilic urbanism enhances resilience, and while some are well-established relationships, others are more tentative and suggest future research and testing.

AB  - In Chapter 5 we highlighted how since the late 1960s an increased emphasis was given to issues of crime prevention, community safety and controlling risk, often in a territorial way, through the design of the built environment. We then argued that these principles during the 1970s and 1980s became more extreme and militarized, and were utilized in very specific ways in certain locations suffering persistent terrorist attack. We further addressed the way in which technological developments, especially linked to the advancement of CCTV, became embedded within a powerful rhetoric of the ‘fortress city’ where security became a strongpoint of sale. © 2009, Jon Coaffee, David Murakami Wood and Peter Rogers.

AB  - Drawing on, and integrating, emerging theories and practices of urban resilience, this article charts the emergence and progression of different waves' of resilience policy in the UK. Specifically, it argues that changing practices of resilience have emerged both as a function of time, and in relation to a range of changing socio-political and economic pressures, which have re-articulated the meaning, scale, operational role of, and responsibility for, resilience. The article seeks to critique resilience policy, raising questions about the usefulness of emerging resilience as the central organising concept for depicting how urban systems respond to contemporary and future crises.

AB  - This article considers the recent catastrophe in New Orleans in terms of “urban resilience,” the capacity of a city to rebound from destruction. Based on a variety of historical examples, I argue that urban resilience is largely a function of resilient and resourceful citizens. Hurricane Katrina not only devastated the built environment of New Orleans but, by forcing a massive evacuation of residents, tore apart its social fabric as well. I maintain that plans to rebuild the physical infrastructure of the city must be accompanied by a commitment to rehabilitate its social fabric and communal networks. Only with strong citizen involvement at the grassroots level will the rebuilding of New Orleans yield a robust and inclusive metropolis, rather than a theme-park shadow of its former self. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In order to create resilience in cities, in Australia and around the world, there will need to be: renewable energy strategies showing how to progressively tap local resources; carbon-neutral strategies that can enforce energy efficiency, integrate with the renewables strategy and direct the carbon offsets into the bioregion; distributed infrastructure strategies that enable small-scale energy and water systems to flourish; biophilic or green infrastructure strategies that include the photosynthetic resources of the city and which can enhance the green agenda across the city through food, fibre, biodiversity and recreation pursuits locally; eco-efficiency strategies linking industries to achieve fundamental changes in the metabolism of cities; sense-of-place strategies to ensure the human dimension is driving all the other strategies; and sustainable transport strategies. This chapter explores how elements of these requirements have been achieved nationally and internationally and what more needs to be done to achieve resilient cities in Australia.

AB  - Urbanization is a global multidimensional process paired with increasing uncertainty due to climate change, migration of people, and changes in the capacity to sustain ecosystem services. This article lays a foundation for discussing transitions in urban governance, which enable cities to navigate change, build capacity to withstand shocks, and use experimentation and innovation in face of uncertainty. Using the three concrete case cities-New Orleans, Cape Town, and Phoenix-the article analyzes thresholds and cross-scale interactions, and expands the scale at which urban resilience has been discussed by integrating the idea from geography that cities form part of ``system of cities{''} (i.e., they cannot be seen as single entities). Based on this, the article argues that urban governance need to harness social networks of urban innovation to sustain ecosystem services, while nurturing discourses that situate the city as part of regional ecosystems. The article broadens the discussion on urban resilience while challenging resilience theory when addressing human-dominated ecosystems. Practical examples of harnessing urban innovation are presented, paired with an agenda for research and policy.

AB  - Resilience is a concept incorporating a vast range of contemporary risks and over recent years has become increasingly important to our understanding of contemporary planning policy and practice. This paper examines the changing nature of resilience strategies since 2000 and highlights how planners increasingly are asked to contribute to this agenda. Drawing on the emerging theories of urban resilience, this paper charts the emergence of different 'styles' of resilience over the last decade in the UK, with an emphasis on a range of policies associated with designing safer spaces. Emerging lessons are then deployed to highlight how a new generation of urban resilience practice is now emerging associated with embedding resiliency into local place-making activities. This paper concludes by reflecting upon the multiple uses of resilience in planning practice. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article discusses urban conditions in cities that in their recent history experienced war. It puts the social component of the city into relationship with the destroyed and dangerous urban environment. In the period between 1992 and 1996 in Sarajevo and in other Bosnian cities, survival became the most important activity for citizens. In the period directly preceding the war, urban conditions-mobility, infrastructure, and services-started to malfunction. As a result, ordinary city life became an object of new urban imageries influenced by new urban conditions and rules of behavior. The first bombing of the city on 6 April 1992 was a sign that the war had started. It brought with it war urban conditions: lack of public transport, electricity, water, and food. The inability of the city and the people living in it to function normally demanded new patterns of urban resilience, which were partly a product of the city's prewar conditions. Using Sarajevo as a case study, this article examines whether the city had predisaster coping strategies and, if so, the extent to which these plans were used during the war. Finally, the article observes how citizens, with their own imageries about cities, can participate in the creation of patterns of urban resilience and future predisaster strategies.

AB  - Social and physical climate change scientists agree that to effectively address climate change, we will need new `technologies' of cooperation. Placing collaborative governance at centre stage, this paper explores how best to develop resilient cities based on best practice and innovative design. After researching best practice stakeholder collaboration, this paper analyses the common themes that characterize climate adaptation strategies, and documents the success factors typifying best practice. Based on this research and experience, it outlines the IFOK model for new governance and supporting institutional strategies. In addition, the paper argues that a more radical redesign of engagement and governance will be critical in order to achieve community resilience and joint action. It outlines how this can be achieved through collaborative governance, involving the deliberated wisdom of ordinary citizens, i.e. by instituting deliberative democracy. Examples of deliberative democratic practice across the globe are highlighted, including an innovative initiative to develop a deliberative community and collaborative governance in regional Western Australia.

AB  - Drawing on Simmel's view of the modern metropolis, the article provides a reflection on the present research on megacities and likewise a corrective to approaches focusing too unilaterally on risks. At the same time the emergence and advancement of megacities will be explored in the context of the current processes of urbanization, globalization, and metropolization. It will be argued that a ``hazards perspective{''} on major cities needs to be complemented by a focus on the potential of these cities, i.e., on hope, creativity, and urban resilience. Overall, it is concluded that city size is not necessarily an obstacle to sustainability.

AB  - In recent years, the activity of protecting against and planning responses to the wide range of security challenges that threaten cities and urban areas-from natural disasters such as flooding and anthropogenic climate change to crime and terrorism-has been referred to as `urban resilience'. In this sense, urban resilience refers to both the design alterations (structural, architectural, land-use planning) and managerial and governance measures that seek to prevent or mitigate the physical and social vulnerability of areas, ultimately to protect life, property and economic activity. Against this background, this paper analyses attempts to embed physical and managerial resilience in urban areas to counter the risk from terrorist attacks. Specifically, it highlights the expanded role for the spatial planning system in meeting and mediating pressures for increased safety and security. Drawing on historical examples, but paying particular attention to the current UK context, the paper details how the planning profession is becoming more responsible for counter-terrorism; this is leading not only to requirements for further training but also to concerns regarding efficacy. This work also questions how proportionate the pressures to achieve counter-terrorism resilience are, particularly given the higher likely incidence and impact of natural disasters.

Landscape ecologists are poised to contribute to this challenge in a transdisciplinary mode in which science and research are integrated with planning policies and design applications. Five strategies to build resilience capacity and transdisciplinary collaboration are proposed: biodiversity; urban ecological networks and connectivity; multifunctionality; redundancy and modularization, adaptive design. Key research questions for landscape ecologists, planners and designers are posed to advance the development of knowledge in an adaptive mode. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - With accelerating global changes, cities have to cope with growing pressures, especially for resource supply. Cities may be considered as resources reservoirs and producers of secondary resources. This paper introduces the concept of urban harvesting as a management tool to change inefficient linear urban resource usage and waste production into sustainable urban metabolism. The Urban Harvest concept includes urban metabolism and closing urban cycles by harvesting urban resources. The purpose of this study was to quantify the potentials to harvest water and energy at different scales. We investigated potentials for the Netherlands. Results show that at national scale, potentials can cover up to 100% of electricity demand, 55% of heat demand and 52% of tap water demand. At neighborhood level, similar percentages were found for energy. Only 43% of water demand was achieved, due to fact that treatment measures were not considered. These results indicate the large potential of cities as providers of their own resources. Therefore urban resources management is a key element of future city design towards more resilient cities. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: COPD morbidity is a good example of how the urban form may interfere with a disease's severity. Then, it may play an important role as a stimulus to increase the acceptability of several policy actions that aim to upgrade urban resilience. Despite the multiple dimensions of wellbeing, health is surely a key variable attracting everyone's attention, which is thus more likely to be able to persuade people that actions that may at first seem undesirable are fundamental in improving urban sustainability and well-being. Methods: After creating a short list of socio-economic and environmental factors relating to the onset and aggravation of COPD, daily admissions distributions were compared using both a non-weighted and a weighted multi-criteria hierarchical analysis procedure. Results: Porto's COPD Social and Environmental Inequalities Index (SEII), calculated with a hierarchical analysis procedure, accurately illustrates a great relationship between COPD admissions and adverse urban form variables. Conclusion: COPD may be an important communication tool to stimulate the acceptability of some otherwise unpopular planning measures to improve urban resilience (sustainability and well-being). © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - The notions of urban resilience and the resilient city have gained considerable attention and interest over recent years, not only in relation to environmental management but also in terms of urban planning. The notion of urban resilience is not just confined to academic discourses - it is increasingly prevalent in urban policy documents. This paper examines awareness and understanding of urban resilience in the planning policy arena in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where planning has a long history of managing water. Specific attention in the paper is paid to the issue of climate change and how planning processes in the city consider or deal with the risks that it presents. The ways in which the city assesses and prepares for these risks or threats form the two main areas of analysis. The paper concludes that evidence of resilient thinking can be found at all levels of decision-making, ranging from the transnational to local levels. However, the notion of resilience is still quite fuzzy and its significance can vary substantially between policy officials and between policy documents, sometimes even within the same administration. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As estimated by UN, in 2030, 95 \% of population growth will result from urban areas while a few metropolitan areas of rapidly growing developing countries will absorb much of this growth. Due to the accelerated urban growth and uncontrolled urban dispersion through naturally significant areas, sustainable urban growth management becomes a critical urban development policy for the global agenda. Istanbul has been attracting much of the internal migration with a dramatic urban growth process since 1950s and Istanbul Province, with over 12 million people in 2010, is the most populated city of Turkey. Sultanbeyli, as a unique case for informal housing development in Istanbul, expanded like mushrooming after 1980's and located itself on the largest drinking water source of Istanbul: the Omerli Watershed. The population of the Sultanbeyli District grew from 82,298 (1990 census) to 272,758 people (2007 census) (TUIK, 1990; 2007): more than threefold increase in less than two decades with consequent environmental degradation, uncontrolled ground water pumping, lack of drinking and waste water infrastructures. These factors endanger the well-being of the environment and of the society. On the other hand, the serious poverty problem is the main concern in Sultanbeyli for urban resilience (UR) which can be defined as the degree to which cities are able to tolerate alteration before reorganizing around a new set of structures and processes and which can be measured by how well a city can simultaneously balance ecosystem services (ES) and human functions (Resilience Alliance, 2007). This paper aims to discuss how to integrate ecosystem services and resilience theory which will be essential to resolve the problems reflected by social, economic and administrative characteristics of the Sultanbeyli District to enhance its urban resilience capacity in Istanbul.

AB  - In this article I focus on intersections between the National Football League's (NFL) security practices and the US Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) counter-terrorism agenda, including new policies and legal structures that support pre-emption, protection, and preparation activities that manage and mitigate the effects of terrorist attacks. As I will argue, the intensifying and mutually supportive relationship between the NFL and the various forces employed to keep it safe is both unique in US sports and implies the militarization of football fans in somewhat unexpected ways. I will argue that the security strategies of the US government and those of the NFL are mutually beneficial in ways that help secure the NFL's position and profitability and, more importantly, help implement and secure consensus for the US Department of Homeland Security's continued ‘war on terror’. Coaffee's recent work on urban resilience in the UK (Coaffee, 2009; Coaffee and Wood, 2006) contends that in the present historical moment, ‘security is becoming more civic, urban, domestic, and personal’ (Coaffee, 2009: 9). How, if at all, does resilience play out in the context of anti-terrorism policy in post-9/11 America? How, if at all, does US professional football articulate with that policy? These are two key questions I intend to address during the course of this article. © 2012, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change can be considered as one of the main environmental topic of the 21st century (IPCC, 2011). It poses a serious challenge for cities all over the world (EEA, 2012): cities show, on the one hand a high level of vulnerability in face of climate change, on the other hand, they are responsible for 60\% to 80\% of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which represent the main causes of change in climate conditions. In 2011, the 73\% of European population was living in urban areas and the level of urbanization is expected to be at 82\% by 2050 (UN, 2012). Due to the evidence that in Europe the 69\% of all GHG emissions are currently generated by cities, larger and larger is the attention devoted, by scientific literature and policy makers, to outline strategies for urban adaptation to climate change, both at European and local scale. Governments and scholars currently highlight the need for strengthening urban resilience in face of climate change and related consequences. By this perspective, some actions are already running, even though a clear identification of the features which make a city resilient in face of climate change is still missing. To fill this gap, this contribution is mainly addressed to: provide, by integrating different disciplinary perspectives, a conceptual model of the set of adaptive capacities and properties that characterize a resilient system; verify, starting from a snapshot of current strategies and actions for urban adaptation currently implemented at European level, the consistency between those strategies and the identified set of resilience capacities and properties.

AB  - The term ``resilience{''} is used in many disciplines with different meanings. We will adopt the ecological concept of resilience, which epitomises the capacity of a system to adapt itself in response to the action of a force, achieving a state of equilibrium different from the original (White, 2011). Since the end of the last century, with a significant increase over the last few years, resilience has featured as key concept in many technical, political papers and documents, and appears in many researches. Of all this recent and varied range of literature, our focus is on those texts that combine resilience with strategies, processes and models for resilient cities, communities and regions. Starting from the resilience strategies developed as response for risks mitigation, the paper thus explores other approaches and experiences on cities resilience that have been conducted: the aim is to compare and identify innovation in the planning process towards risks mitigation. In this paper we present a summary of the initial survey stage of our research, with three main aims: understanding the approaches to resilience developed so far and identifying which aspects these approaches share (or not); - understanding which strategies are being proposed for resilient regions, cities or social ecological systems; - understanding whether proposed resilience strategies involve innovations in urban and regional development disciplines. The aim is to understand whether the proposed concept of resilience, or rather strategies, constitute progress and contribute to innovation in the areas of urban planning and design in relation to risk mitigation.

AB  - This article is about cities and climate change, and about ways to make cities more resilient to the effects of climate change. It presents the two dominant strategies of mitigation and adaptation, and goes on to present a systems view on the city in which resilience is the key response to climate change. The article argues that resilience depends on three dimensions or areas: a city's physical form, infrastructure and technology, its people and particular multilevel governance, levels of human connectedness and communal self-reliance, and the innovative capacity as well as the level of inclusion of marginalized groups within the economy. Teaching and training is seen as an important element in strengthening resilience, and the article presents a number of case studies showing the relevance of learning processes as conditions to work successfully in urban networks in the areas mentioned. The article takes organizational learning as its main orientation and presents important concepts such as "reflective action", "learning by doing", "mental maps", the "experiential learning cycle" and the "5 disciplines of the learning organization". This forms the base for the design of concrete educational material. This material is centered on a number of eco-cultural innovations: concrete ideas, technologies, systems or activities that focus on neighborhood-based activities that reinforce the local economy or introduce small-scale technology for water, renewable energy or waste. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article identifies the future challenges that cities face in their ability to create well-being, particularly for urban poor communities, as a result of the compound effect generated by climate change - distinguishing between direct impacts, indirect effects and pre-existing vulnerability. This suggests that action to reduce exposure and improve the adaptive capacity of urban populations must therefore simultaneously address disaster risk reduction, urban poverty reduction and urban resilience (i.e. the ability of the city to maintain the functions that support the well-being of its citizens). Based on evidence and experience from 10 cities which form part of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (www.acccrn.org), this article proposes that a simplified conceptual model and resilience characteristics be used to analyse urban systems, in parallel with spatial analysis, to target action at multiple levels to reduce exposure and improve the adaptive capacity of urban populations simultaneously. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Arup.

AB  - This paper contributes to filling the theoretical and practical gaps of city resilience literature, which lacks multifaceted theorizing and typically overlooks the multidisciplinary and complex nature of urban resilience. Furthermore, most studies on the subject make use of general, vague, and confusing terminology. This paper suggests a new innovative conceptual framework (the Resilient City Planning Framework or RCPF) that addresses the critical question of what cities and their urban communities should do in order to move towards a more resilient state in the future. Accordingly, the RCPF takes complexity and uncertainty into account. It is affected by a multiplicity of economic, social, spatial, and physical factors and its planning involves a wide range of stakeholders. RCPF is a network of four interlinked concepts that together, provide a comprehensive understanding of City Resilience. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays, the most common approach to seismic risk mitigation is characterized only by strategies reducing building vulnerability, through structural interventions, and it does not consider the possibility to intervene at urban scale, reducing urban seismic vulnerability. This paper deals with the concept of urban seismic vulnerability, and introduces resilience, as the capacity of a system to adapt itself to new, generally negative, conditions, in order to re-establish normal conditions. Each city can express resilience, and the identification of its elements is the goal of our research. A spatial multi-criteria approach is here proposed.

AB  - The damage caused by a dramatic worldwide increase in so-called natural disasters is staggering, with the poor in developing countries being most at risk. This paper analyses: (a) the key variables and their causal relations that underlie the complex system of risk and disaster occurrence in slums; (b) the impacts of disasters on slums; (c) the strategies used by local people to cope with risk and disasters; and (d) the reasons for weak coping. The views and knowledge of slum dwellers in El Salvador are the focus of this analysis. On this basis, five complementary ex ante risk-reduction measures have been identified and developed to match local needs, capacities and dimensions of risk-hazard reduction (or prevention), mitigation, preparedness, risk `financing' and stand-by for recovery. The complementary measures provide a frame of reference that allows urban development actors to systematically search for and design potential risk reduction measures. It is concluded that keeping these measures compartmentalised and separate from each other during planning and implementation of urban development programmes helps ensure both sustainable poverty reduction and urban resilience.

AB  - In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, policy makers are once again debating the manner in which we prepare for, respond to, and recover from extreme events in the United States. While much is known about how to make urban regions safer, political and economic calculations often overwhelm these considerations. The mix of competing priorities and incentives of federal, state, and local officials conspire to make urban hazard planning difficult if not impossible. The considerable challenge facing those charged with making cities less vulnerable is to strike an appropriate balance between these political and economic dynamics, and the creation of more disaster-resilient communities. © 2006 Sage Publications.

AB  - The article carries out a meditation on the concept of habitability as an evaluation factor for sustainable buildings. Currently the concept of habitability has become an important tool in design and construction. Population growth and climate change affect this factor. Poorly designed buildings do not meet new environmental conditions and do not act in response to resource availability. Therefore, the change in living conditions should trigger the design of resilient cities and buildings, to provide adequate solutions to these phenomena. The article proposes a model that allows for innovation in the design of resilient buildings and cities, as well as for software for evaluating and guiding design variables towards habitability as a sustainability factor. The article concludes applying a proposal specifically to Bogota's conditions.

AB  - Numerous recommendations are emerging to guide cities in developing risk assessments and climate adaptation plans. In some instances, these recommendations are appropriate. However, since many are drawn from traditional approaches to comprehensive planning and from climate mitigation programs, they often do not account for the unique challenges associated with urban adaptation or provide guidance that is sensitive to the distinctive social, cultural, institutional, and administrative characteristics of particular locales. In this paper, which captures a panel discussion convened at the Resilient Cities Congress 2010, expert practitioners and academics review emerging wisdom about best practices in adaptation planning, draw on their experience and research findings to challenge these assumptions, and show what we can learn about process and outcomes from cities at the forefront.

AB  - Environmental design and planning are important tools for human adaptation. Designers and planners depend on experience, craft, and environmental knowledge to shape preferred futures. Ecological literacy would enhance the design and planning of built environments. The concepts of "resilience" and "ecosystem" offer opportunities for collaboration between ecologists and practitioners in the design and planning disciplines. Urban resilience to natural disasters and coastal "green" infrastructure represent two areas where design and planning based on ecological principles should be applied.

AB  - While cultural diversity is increasing in cities at a global level as a result of urbanization, biodiversity is decreasing with a subsequent loss of ecosystem services. It is clear that diversity plays a pivotal role in the resilience building of ecosystems; however, it is less clear what role cultural diversity plays in the resilience building of urban systems. In this paper we provide innovative insights on how common property systems could contribute to urban resilience building. Through a review of recent findings on urban common property systems and the relevant literature, we deal with urban green commons (UGCs) and discuss their potential to manage cultural and biological diversity in cities. We describe three examples of UGCs, i.e. collectively managed parks, community gardens, and allotment areas, with a focus on their institutional characteristics, their role in promoting diverse learning streams, environmental stewardship, and social-ecological memory. We discuss how UGCs can facilitate cultural integration through civic participation in urban land-management, conditions for the emergence of UGCs, the importance of cognitive resilience building, and what role property-rights diversity plays in urban settings. We conclude by elucidating some key insights on how UGCs can promote urban resilience building. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The impact of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans revealed vulnerabilities caused by the interaction of the city's fragile physical environment, aging infrastructure, and declining economic and social structure. The hurricane constituted a triggering event, but the severe destruction and heavy losses documented the extraordinary costs of inadequate plans and practice, given the city's high exposure to risk. This condition and its sobering consequences are not limited to New Orleans, but constitute a silent threat for other cities in the United States and the world. The challenge for cities is to create a new vision of vital, resilient communities that are able to assess and manage their own risk in order to limit escalating damage from extreme events. © 2006 Sage Publications.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the contribution of the UNESCO biosphere reserve concept to urban resilience. Design/methodology/ approach: The paper examines the challenges underpinning the problem of environmental degradation in cities. It then briefly considers available initiatives that can be implemented toward the realization of more sustainable cities. A case is made for the possible contribution of the UNESCO biosphere reserve concept as a useful urban management tool. Findings: Urban administrators have a range of tools to select from to support the design and management of sustainable cities. It is argued that the UNESCO biosphere reserve concept is potentially a very valuable tool, although, apart from academic studies, not truly tested in an urban context. Originality/value: Biological diversity is the very essence that sustains life on earth and forms the basis of quality living conditions, even within built-up areas. Today, cities are facing the pressures of increasing populations and the effects thereof on the environment. The challenge facing cities is how to improve the quality of life of all city dwellers amidst the environmental challenge of dwindling natural resources. The paper looks at a number of initiatives available to city administrators in their quest to create liveable cities. It is perhaps timeous to research the potential applicability of the biosphere reserve framework as an urban tool toward more resilient, environmentally acceptable urban landscapes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - `Relocalisation' is defined as aiming to return communities to a more local basis, including in disaster risk reduction. In 2005, Boulder Valley, Colorado, USA formed a non-profit, non-governmental organisation to implement relocalisation. In late 2006 and early 2007, the group's leaders decided to pursue relocalisation as a for-profit venture and effectively eliminated disaster risk reduction from the relocalisation agenda. This paper analyses these actions and the consequences for relocalisation through the framework of good governance, which involves the principles of participation, transparency, accountability, rule of law, effectiveness and equity.

AB  - This paper reviews research on urban agriculture which relates to the three dimensions of sustainability: social, economic and environmental. We propose that urban agriculture has three elements: urban agriculture in isolation; its interface with the people and environment within which it is situated; and its contribution to the design of built form. Additionally, we consider its scale: micro, meso and macro. The analysis draws attention to legal, social and economic constraints and opportunities. It suggests that future priorities for research should be directed towards (i) strategically identifying principles of sustainable urban agriculture that help policy makers to design resilient cities, e.g. using flood-prone areas for food and employment, and (ii) operationally trialling innovative institutional mechanisms, e.g. differential land taxes to support sustainable urban agriculture or payments for environmental services provided by urban agriculture such as carbon sequestration. © 2010 Earthscan.

AB  - Inequities in education, the urban environment, and health co-exist and mutually reinforce each other. Educators, planners, and public health practitioners share commitments to place-based, participatory, youth-focused, and equitable work. They also have shared goals of building community resilience, social capital, and civic engagement. Interdisciplinary programs that embody these shared values and work towards these shared goals are emerging, including school-based health centers, full-service community schools, community health centers, Promise Neighborhoods, and Choice Neighborhoods. The intersection of these three fields represents an opportunity to intervene on social determinants of health. More collaborative research and practice across public health, education, and planning should build from the shared values identified to continue to address these common goals.

AB  - It is possible to detect a shift in the way we think about environmental issues, in particular climate change, from what academics call `ecological modernization' to what can be termed `resilient cities'. This is both a consequence and a cause of city regions emerging as the pragmatic scale of governance. This article will use a case study of Greater Manchester in the northwest of England to show how thinking on the environment was centred around `ecological modernization' with an emphasis on business opportunities associated with a move to a low-carbon economy. It will argue that this approach has been enhanced by a new focus on resilience. The case study will use examples of the Ecocities project, green infrastructure and flood risk to show how a concern for resilience has emerged. It will then revisit the issue of energy to show how the new concerns have influenced the low-carbon strategy.

With their high degree of interdependency, urban networks and services are critical issues for the resilience of a city. And yet, network managers are scarcely aware of their flaws and dependencies and they are reluctant to take them into account. In order to develop an operational tool to improve urban resilience, we propose here an auto-diagnosis method to be completed by network managers. The subsequent confrontation of all diagnoses is the basis of collaborative research for problem identification and solution design. The tool is experimented with the Parisian urban transport society.

AB  - Critical infrastructures (CI) systems provide essential services ``for the maintenance of critical societal functions, including the supply chain, health, safety, security and economic or social well-being of the people{''} (European Commission, 2008). These systems are exposed to a great number of hazards and threats, which may result in severe consequences for the population, the socioeconomic system, and the environment. The issue is particularly relevant at urban level, where the disruption of one CI system can propagate to the other systems and paralyze the entire area. It is therefore necessary, not only to protect CIs through Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) strategies, but also to enhance the resilience of these areas. This article aims thus at providing some insights related to the evolution of the critical infrastructures disaster mitigation strategies from the sole protection towards resilience: what kind of strategies based on resilience can be developed to address CIs disruption at local or regional level? To what extent do these strategies contribute to increase the resilience level of the entire urban or metropolitan area? The first section focuses on the urban critical infrastructures systems as well as on the way their disruption can impact urban areas. The second section provides with some examples of key measures to operationalize resilience in the field of critical infrastructure disaster mitigation strategies. The last section highlights how the key measures developed to enhance the resilience against CI disruptions can benefit also to broader urban resilience.

AB  - Climate change governance is increasingly being conducted through urban climate change experiments, purposive interventions that seek to reconfigure urban sociotechnical systems to achieve low-carbon and resilient cities. In examining how experiments take effect, we suggest that we need to understand not only how they are made and assembled, but also how they are maintained within specific urban contexts. Drawing on literatures from urban political ecology and the specific debate on urban repair and maintenance, this article examines maintenance in two case studies of climate change experiments in housing in Bangalore (India) and Monterrey (Mexico). We find that maintenance is a crucial process through which not only urban obduracy is preserved, but also the novel and innovative character of the experiment is asserted and reproduced. The process of maintaining' experiments is a precarious one, which requires a continuous external input in terms of remaking the experiment materially and discursively. This process causes further reconfigurations beyond the experiment, changing the patterns of responsibility attribution and acceptability that configure the urban fabric.

AB  - To what must cities be resilient? How can cities, as complex systems, be resilient? Building a capacity for resilience might be a daunting task when one considers the multitude of components, processes, and interactions that take place within and beyond a city's physical, logical (i.e. legal), and virtual (cyberspace) boundaries. Planning for resilience to the impacts of stressors within cities requires an evaluation of the vulnerable components of cities, an understanding of the key processes, procedures, and interactions that organize these components and develop the capacity to address various structuring of components and their interactions with the ultimate goal of achieving resilience. This paper provides a deeper look at resilience in cities, proposes a conceptual resilience framework, and includes a discussion and analysis of the framework. The proposed framework is meant to serve as a more holistic approach to designing, planning, and managing for resilience by including an evaluation of cultural and process dynamics within cities as well as their physical elements. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study uses multilevel regression analysis to examine the effect of social characteristics and the built environment on clearance time under an evacuation scenario. The primary unit of analysis is the US Census tract (N = 1660), nested within 31 incorporated places spanning five US states. The dependent variable is an estimate of clearance time in hours derived using network analysis techniques within a geographic information system. We find that tracts with a more peripheral location, more female residents, a higher proportion of Hispanic residents, and higher median household incomes are associated with higher clearance times, on average. Our research suggests the relationship between suburbanization and clearance time is complex and evolving, mediated by past investments in the built environment and shifting social conditions. In addition to facilitating the evacuation of areas with low access to personal vehicles, urban planners and emergency management officials should also consider how the degree of connectivity in the street network impacts congestion and clearance time. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Twenty-first century cities in developing countries have been facing development challenges as a result of their fast-growing urban populations and inefficient infrastructures, as well as growing difficulties created by climate change. Though concern for integrating disaster risk management approaches into development planning has been expressed in various policy documents and studies, exact methods of such integration at the spatial level are still being deliberated. The concepts of quality of life (QoL) and disaster resiliency are closely linked and their interrelationship is understood from the definitions and concepts developed in different studies. A disaster can have a negative impact on QoL and resiliency for disaster can protect and maintain QoL. This study develops an approach for integrating disaster resiliency into QoL based on new urbanization models, which can be re-orientated towards achieving resiliency. The Quality of Life with Disaster Resiliency (QoLDR) index offers the integration of resiliency issues arising from the urbanization process as well as natural hazards. It also provides directions for altering urbanization and increases adaptability, which results in resilient urbanization. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Extreme weather events, such as unusually high or low temperatures, severe winds and heavy precipitation, pose a threat to people and property in cities, and are expected to become more frequent and intense as a result of climate change. Managing this risk requires effective climate adaptation policies - strategic courses of action designed to strengthen urban resilience to climate-related stress. City governments have a key role to play in adaptation policy design, but they appear to face challenges in marshalling political commitment and technical capacity. This article examines elements of urban climate adaptation policy targeting extreme weather and analyzes the policy development process in two major Canadian cities, Toronto and Halifax.

AB  - The article explores the threats posed to metropolitan viability and resilience in South Africa which is faced by continued spatial and economic concentration and duality - a trend also evident in a number of Central European countries. Examples are provided of trends and challenges impacting the resilience of South Africa's metropolitan regions, as identified in recent empirical studies conducted by the authors.' The paper argues that the agglomeration challenges facing South Africa's metropolitan regions and complications brought about by intra-metropolitan inequality are key aspects underlying the resilience of these regions. The article also suggests that there might be value in greater collaboration in research and knowledge-production and sharing in metropolitan planning, development and governance, between South African metropolitan regions and those in Central European countries.

AB  - Unsustainable urban development has a negative impact on human health. African cities already face huge demands with regard to human health and urban sustainability, and global environmental change will increase these challenges, making it even more imperative that human health and urban sustainability are simultaneously addressed in locally appropriate ways. Key areas of intersection include increased temperatures, drought, flooding, the decreased ability of ecosystems to provide health-enhancing services (clean air, water and soil) and increasing urban food insecurity. There are a range of strategies that can be used to improve urban resilience and sustainability while simultaneously improving human health. The key challenge, however, is transforming African urban governance systems, so that objectives such as sustainability and improved health can be met. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The notion of resilience is gaining increasing prominence across a diverse set of literatures on cities and climate change. Although there is some disagreement among these different literatures about how to define and measure resilience, there is broad consensus that: (1) cities must become resilient to a wider range of shocks and stresses in order to be prepared for climate change; and (2) efforts to foster climate change resilience must be bundled with efforts to promote urban development and sustainability. Emerging issues for future study highlight some of the challenges associated with practical application of resilience approaches. These include responding to equity concerns associated with uneven patterns of resilience both within and across cities, assessing the costs of implementing resilience strategies, and identifying options for harnessing the innovation potential in cities as a means to foster resilience and sustainability. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Using the city of Toronto as a case study, this article examines impacts of energy stocks and flexible demand in the urban metabolism on the resilience of the city, including discussion of directions for further study of the resiliency of the urban metabolism. An important element developed is the nominal residence time of the energy stocks. This value defines how long an energy stock lasts under typical patterns of energy use. The findings suggest that the residence times of many sources of energy overcome vulnerability when energy supply shocks last on the order of hours or a few days, but that the measure is limited to assessing only certain types of commonly used energy sources in aggregate terms. Discussion is included on the uncertainty of this measure and on the metabolic and resiliency implications of new technologies intended to reduce energy use and improve sustainability of cities and the use of the urban metabolism as a means of comparison. The methodology employed highlights how waste energy could be used to increase the resiliency of the city's water supply, but also how the study of the urban metabolism would benefit from a more disaggregate form in the study of sustainable and resilient cities.

AB  - Purpose - The rapidly expanding urban areas of the world constitute an environmental challenge for the 21st century that requires both new analytic approaches and new sources of data and information in micro and macro level. Management of land use sprawl in urban area especially in developing countries using GIS and Remote sensing tools still in vague although these tool may provide the benefit on fundamental observations of urban encroachment and environmental monitoring that are not available from other sources (Batty and Howes, 2001). Therefore, this paper attempts to analyze the capability and reviewing the research and works done recently on GIS and remote sensing in managing urban land use sprawl in developing countries in order to increase the resilience of cities with diverse dynamics. Design/methodology/approach - Increasing availability of GIS and remotely sensed application on urban planning purposes can be seen on capabilities of broad spatial coverage, capacity of routine and unobtrusive updating and the ability to provide self-consistent measurement will be consider as a main indicator in the process of analyzing and reviewing for works have been done. The quantitative and qualitative data analyzed using statistical approach were used in identifying the main success and failures of each study, and the main underlying reasons with comparing the result obtained for the different places in developing countries. An integrated various subsystem allows the analysis of GIS and remote sensing on urban land use sprawl to generate the result of how they manage the urban land use sprawl in further provide number of solid contribution to the wider theoretical debate on this study contexts. Originality/value - This paper represents an attempt to compare and evaluate and determine a degree of synthesize the work that has been done to develop and embed creativity and innovation of space technologies in the urban planning development. The methodology puts in evidence the strength and ability of knowledge on information system for intellectual capital and management especially for urban planning development (Mohd Noor and Hashim, 2009a and 2009b). It relates to recent development of GIS and remote sensing in urban planning which prove that the tool has a value of incorporating the complexity and dynamic of urban area into virtual with consider the relevant mechanism which highly have potential value in real world in terms of micro and macro level. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application entail mostly the theoretical and practical implication on urban development which should take the effect of land use sprawl and try to manage the phenomena with controlling the encroachment and limit the sprawl with using GIS and Remote Sensing in urban area which further can facilitate the organisation and cities in managing the land use sprawl phenomena recently hit the city in developing countries (Wu, 2006).

AB  - Information, communication and knowledge creation are at the core of urban stakeholder interactions enabling the identification of vulnerabilities and the design of adequate responses to them. Urban infostructures play a crucial role within these processes, interfacing between a city's ecological, social, technical, economic and political networks. Against this backdrop, this paper discusses the governance and design of urban infostructures from a socio-technical systems perspective. It, therefore, reviews pertinent technology components, as well as institutional and discursive frameworks and their respective influence on the identification and assessment of vulnerabilities and resilience building in cities. It concludes that approaches to developing urban infostructures should be a major concern when addressing urban resilience. There is a need to fully account for the hybrid character of urban infostructures as socio-technical systems, while also seizing opportunities for targeted transformation.

AB  - Natural hazards, due to climate change, are particularly damaging in urban areas because of interdependencies of their networks. So, urban resilience has to face up to climate risks. The most impacting phenomenon is the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The storage capacity of heat is depending on shapes of buildings, public spaces, spatial organization, transport or even industrial activities. So, adaptive strategies for improving urban climate could be possible in different ways. In the framework of the French project Resilis, this study characterises urban vulnerability and resilience in terms of energy needs of buildings and outside urban comfort according to the IPCC carbon dioxide emission scenarios B2 and A2 for the period 2050-2100 for 10 French cities. The evolutions of four climate indicators in terms of heating and cooling needs and number of hours when the temperature is above 28 °C are then obtained for each city to analyse climate risks and their impacts in urban environment. © Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Urbanized delta areas worldwide share a growing tendency of exposure to water stress induced by the effects of climate change and anthropogenic factors, threatening the operation of infrastructure systems and future urban development. The important synergistic impacts coexisting with freshwater scarcity are increasing urbanization rates, subsiding soils, saltwater intrusion in aquifers and rivers, coastal erosion, and increased flooding. Innovative design strategies and concepts for the integration of decentralized rainwater management measures can contribute to the integrated and climate resilient planning of urban spaces that are threatened by climate change scenarios that worsen the security of urban infrastructures and the future availability of fresh water. Decentralized rainwater management, including retention, storage, and reuse strategies that are integrated into spatial planning and urban design, can reduce flood risks while simultaneously enhancing freshwater availability. This paper discusses a paradigm shift in urban water management, from centralized to decentralized management (that is, from threats to opportunities), using the example of two case studies. Concepts and strategies for building climate resilient cities, which address flood control, the protection of freshwater resources, and the harmonization of a natural and more sustainable water balance, are presented for Almere (Rhine Schelde Delta, The Netherlands) and Hsingchu (Dotzpu Delta, Taiwan).

AB  - Worldwide city authorities are facing problems in terms of rapid urbanization but also in terms of resilience against natural disasters and the effects of climate change. The UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction program is asking cities `How resilient is your city'. The ITA Committee on Underground Space (ITACUS) is working together with UNISDR to demonstrate how the use of underground space can contribute to making cities more resilient. The use of underground space is underrated worldwide, yet it can prove to be invaluable to city governments as a strategic planning asset. This paper explores the issues and shows how underground space is already contributing. The main focus will be on those aspects that help cities cope with rapid urbanization and their efforts to become more resilient. Areas which will be explored include buildings, transport, energy supply, water and waste. The question will also be raised whether the use of underground space can take place as an autonomous activity or whether planning the use of underground space is required. In the opinion of the author the latter is the case. City governments require awareness of both the advantages of underground space use but also of the need to plan using this asset in a sustainable way. Only in that way will the use of underground space be to the advantage of cities.

AB  - This paper outlines the conflicts and synergies between risk and resilience approaches to climate change adaptation planning in vulnerable coastal areas of Australia. It examines whether current planning processes shaping vulnerable coastal settlements in Australia are sufficiently informed to build adaptive capacity for their communities under climate change impacts. Considerable research to date has focused on the application of risk management in identifying vulnerabilities and predicted worst-case scenarios. This approach often proposes `hard' infrastructure changes for climate change adaptation. However, little work has been done looking at the processes for implementing and supporting such adaptation strategies while addressing the inherent uncertainty of future climate change impacts. This so-called `soft' infrastructure is critical to building a community's ability to innovate and prosper while adapting to unforeseen challenges posed by a changing climate. It is argued that introducing concepts of resilience to municipal planning processes for vulnerable coastal settlements, particularly in development control plans (DCP's) may provide a more comprehensive approach to climate change adaptation.

AB  - This paper considers how development policy concerns for poverty reduction and social justice can be accommodated in emerging theories and practice on urban resilience and adaptation in response to climate change. There is growing interest in applying resilience to address the challenges of urban climate change. The application of resilience theory has considerable potential for furthering our understanding of the particulars of urban climate vulnerability with its emphasis on complex systems that are increasingly important to urban life. But there are also significant risks. Resilience theory does not adequately address critical issues of power, voice and equity. Moreover, much of the uptake of resilience is as a buzzword rather than a conceptual framework. As such, the discourse of resilience has connotations that can run counter to interests of poverty reduction. Drawing on experience in Asia, the authors argue for a critical application of resilience, with special attention to concerns of resilience for and by whom. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Uncertainty, unpredictability and change have become key characteristics of today's interdependent world. Although risks, disasters and crises are inherent to human existence, the speed, frequency and scale at which they occur today are unprecedented. Natural disasters related to global warming have increased in the last decade. Although climate change is considered a global problem, its impacts are felt locally. Cities, then, must respond earlier and more effectively to risks and hazards. Although both `resilience thinking' and `community based adaptation' have made headway, they have been mainly applied to rural areas and natural resource management at regional levels within social-ecological systems. This paper applies the lessons of resilience thinking and experiences in community-based adaptation efforts to urban areas. The paper argues that participatory knowledge management systems can enhance resilience in urban areas. Participatory knowledge management systems equip stakeholders at the local level to deal more effectively with sudden change, risks, and long-term stresses. Simultaneously, they can foster social capital and trust, strategic leadership, and enhance collective competence - all important components of resilient systems.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to investigate the efficiency of domestic Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) tank to reduce the inflow discharge to stormwater sewer systems, which intends to be an option to increase urban resilience to climate change impacts. A dimensionless methodology developed based on a water balance model at daily temporal scale was applied to determine both the obtainable water saving due to the use of rain water for toilet flushing (i.e. reduce the use of portable water) and meanwhile reduce stormwater volumes discharging to sewer systems by the tank storage. The methodology and a RWH tank system was evaluated applying the daily rainfall data obtained in two met-stations of Blindern in Oslo and Rygge in Fredrikstad, South Norway. Results show, for all the considered scenarios in the two case studies that the use of the rainwater storage tank can provide significant reduction of water volume discharges to the storm water sewer, accordingly the resulting damages during the extreme events will be reduced.

AB  - In 2009, for the first time in history, more people were found to live in urban areas than in rural settings. Predictions for 2025 are that 70\% of the world's population will be urban. Urban dwellers in particular, then, will need to adapt to climate change. Urbanization occurs at a rapid pace in secondary cities across Africa. Indeed, half the increase of urban populations in the coming years is expected to occur in secondary cities. Poor settlements near water bodies (rivers, irrigation systems and large dams) are prone to flooding, which is likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Employing an ecohealth approach, this study explores the vulnerabilities and resilience of poor urban settlers in four secondary cities of West Africa, all located in close proximity to water bodies: Korhogo, Cote d'Ivoire (212,000 inhabitants, near a dam); Kaedi, Mauritania (71,000 inhabitants, near a river); Ziguinchor, Senegal (269,000 inhabitants, near a river); and Kara, Togo (120,000 inhabitants, near a river). The aim of this study is to reinforce the resilience of the most vulnerable of these communities and their capacity to adapt to processes of drought and flooding in two climatic contexts: semi-arid and tropical humid. Local governance authorities play a central role in this project, which emphasizes participatory research, and explores linkages between hazards, vulnerabilities and local adaptive capacity potentials, particularly in the water and health sectors.

AB  - Seismic risk management is generally carried out through strategies aiming to reduce building seismic vulnerability, working on structural features and not considering that the concept of vulnerability can be adopted also referring to the whole urban system. In order to adopt a different approach, considering not only building and infrastructure vulnerability and according to the goal of managing seismic risk reducing urban vulnerability, it is strategic to identify in peace time (before disastrous events) which elements, which activities, which functions of a city have prior importance after the event, to guarantee a rapid response and the reestablishment of normal conditions: this means identifying the resilient city. This study aims to define a methodological approach to identify the resilient city, adopting spatial multicriteria techniques and establishing resilient system identification considering functional, social, morphological, geological and dimensional characteristics of the considered urban system. In particular, some tests, considering a first set of criteria including accessibility, closeness to urban centres and main facilities, closeness to hydrographical networks, slope, map of seismic hazard, areas at high hydro-geological risk and seismic vulnerability of buildings, have been carried out on a town in Basilicata Region (southern Italy), mainly composed of an old part located on a hilltop, a modern part in the valley and a lot of rural settlements. Multicriteria analysis has been led adopting an additive rule, based on a simple additive weighting method.

AB  - Urban designers, ecologists, and social scientists have called for closer links among their disciplines. We examine a promising new tool for promoting this linkage - the metaphor of "cities of resilience." To put this tool to best use, we indicate how metaphor fits with other conceptual tools in science. We then present the two opposing definitions of resilience from ecology, and give reasons why one is more appropriate for linking with design. Additional specific tools and insights that are emerging from, or being increasingly used in, ecology can further support the linkage with urban design. These include recognizing the role of spatial heterogeneity in both ecological and social functioning of urban areas, the integrating power of watersheds, social and ecological patch dynamics of cities, the utility of spatial mosaic models to capture function, the use of an integrated "human ecosystem" modeling framework, and the consequent perspective of metropolitan areas as integrated ecological-social systems. Three additional tools are related to the adaptability of people and human institutions. First is the recognition of a "learning loop" in metropolitan ecosystems in which people respond to and affect ecological change, the use of urban design as experiments whose ecological and social outcomes can be measured, and finally the potency of a dialog between professionals and citizens, communities, and institutions, to support both research and design. The metaphor of resilience, and its technical specifications, draw these diverse strands for linking ecology and planning together. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban resilience is a key focus of current approaches to flood management. The notion of resilience encompasses pre-disaster planning and warning systems, emergency handling procedures and post-disaster reconstruction. Both human and physical systems are involved at all stages. The success of resilience programmes relies on the cooperation of floodplain populations - for example, increasing the installation of structural flood-resistant and resilient features requires significant commitment from property owners. Knowledge of common features of floodplain populations can therefore aid understanding of the ways in which such cooperation can be achieved. A review of international literature relating to flood proofing of homes and the attitudes of floodplain residents reveals that there are many barriers to overcome in encouraging the installation of resilient measures. Many of these barriers are common across surveyed populations: any proposed scheme must contend with informational barriers, emotional constraints, aesthetic considerations and timing issues. Other barriers depend on local circumstances, finance and regulatory regimes. Lessons can be learned from successful schemes that have overcome some or all of these problems if care is exercised in interpreting the scheme benefits in relation to the identified barriers. © © 2009 Thomas Telford Ltd 2009.

AB  - The construction and service of urban infrastructure systems and buildings involves immense resource consumption. Cities are responsible for the largest component of global energy, water, and food consumption as well as related sewage and organic waste production. Due to ongoing global urbanization, in which the largest sector of the global population lives in cities which are already built, global level strategies need to be developed that facilitate both the sustainable construction of new cities and the re-development of existing urban environments. A very promising approach in this regard is the decentralization and building integration of environmentally sound infrastructure systems for integrated resource management. This paper discusses such new and innovative building services engineering systems, which could contribute to increased energy efficiency, resource productivity, and urban resilience. Applied research and development projects in Germany, which are based on integrated system approaches for the integrated and environmentally sound management of energy, water and organic waste, are used as examples. The findings are especially promising and can be used to stimulate further research and development, including economical aspects which are crucial for sustainable urban (re-)development.

AB  - Climate change and energy insecurity are grave threats to the stability and sustainability of human society. This paper considers the meaning of this globally manifest, yet regionally differentiated, ecological threat for Australia's urban system. It also considers the twin ecological peril of oil depletion, whose impacts may intensify to great effect the social stresses likely to emerge as climates warm. The paper intervenes in the debate that transfixes contemporary Australian urbanism: the sustainability of the suburban form in which most Australians live. A similar if not identical debate exists in North America and parts of western Europe. These discussions may be overemphasising the environmental significance of urban form and failing to apprehend the deeper socio-cultural forces that drive the (over) consumption of nature. Planning thought and practice need to loosen the grip of physical determinism on their environmental comprehension if they are to comprehend accurately the sources of, and solutions to, ecological threat. New urban scientific evidence suggests that planning's principal role in the fight against warming will be one of adaptation not mitigation. That is to say, there is no simple `spatial fix' for overconsumption.

AB  - Climate change poses a serious threat to sustainable urban development, placing many cities at risk. As a consequence, city authorities are increasingly facing the challenge of finding ways to include adaptation strategies into their work, although related knowledge and competence is still scarce and fragmented. With the aim to contribute to knowledge development and organizational learning, the objective of this paper is to critically review and compare current theoretical and practical approaches to adaptation planning in cities. In order to do so, first the conceptual characteristics and features of a climate resilient city are identified. Second, the reciprocal linkages between climate-related disasters, urban form and city planning processes are analysed - by considering the life cycle of disasters from causes, to short- and long-term impacts, to post-disaster response and recovery. Finally, urban adaptation measures proposed for both developed and so-called developing countries are assessed. On the basis of the identified differences, gaps and synergies between the theoretical and practical approaches to adaptation planning, the implications for improving sustainable urban transformation are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Inherent to the sustainability discourse is concern about the long-term future. If sustainable, cities must deliver positive benefits over their possibly long lifetime. Yet in formulating guidance and negotiating design choices for urban development, the consideration of uncertainty and potential future adverse conditions leading to failure is difficult to deal with. In this paper an approach to this issue that can inform the planning and/or urban design process is presented. It is based on a scenario analysis methodology (futures analysis), which herein is used to appraise the energy-efficiency strategies currently recommended in the UK planning system and best practice. The built environment is one of the major consumers of energy, and its energy efficiency is thereby central to any attempt to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Through the analysis, some important factors that could undermine good energy performance emerge. Such findings can lead to the making of decisions that can enhance urban resilience. The first part of the paper provides an overview of the energy-efficient strategies examined, as well as current approaches for considering the evolution of present conditions when planning. The second part presents the futures analysis and its significance is demonstrated through a case study.

AB  - Urban stakeholders require quantitative and robust tools to implement new paths to urban sustainability. Urban form, the spatial distribution of activities and urban organization are crucial aspects of cities' sustainability. Many tools and assessment systems have been developed to improve cities' energy efficiency and environmental footprint. However, most of these tools are based on the building scale. Most urban stakeholders are now convinced that a building scale approach is not sufficient: the scale of analysis should evolve from the building to the neighbourhood, district and city scales. An innovative system of indicators is presented that answers the need for multi-scale and cross-scale indicators and encompasses the intrinsic complexity of the city. Based on a morphologic approach, new mathematical formulas are used to generate urban sustainability indicators. These indicators can assist with the comparison of urban projects by using a structural point of view to assess the energy efficiency, social and environmental consequences of different urban forms. A comprehensive table displays 60 indicators and methods to quantify them. Some of these indicators have been quantified for real cities and are presented. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper concerns the methods of analysis of the configuration of the urban grids. More in details, it will focus on the configurational approach to the analysis of urban settlements, briefly presenting the different methods and techniques it has inspired, sketching their features, highlighting their actual utility and their respective advantages and limits. Moreover, it will propose the use of some further configurational parameters, suitable for describing and reproducing interesting features of urban settlements; more in details, it will cast attention onto the richness and the variety of paths within a settlement, what makes it resilient, that is capable of sustaining changes and transformations without radically modifying its inner geography. Such parameters have been tested on the case studies of Pisa and Venice, which can easily be recognised as particularly relevant and significant, in that the results they provide are diametrically different. Those outputs will then be presented and discussed; the findings are suitable for suggesting resilience as a singular clue for urban orientation, so that the configurational techniques can be proposed as a tool for evaluating and predicting this spatial attitude, here finding an Ariadne's thread for urban wayfinding.

AB  - Adapting to the challenges of rapid urban growth and societal change will require mechanisms for efficient transitioning to an embedded resilience. This has become central to the exploration of methods for achieving truly sustainable urban growth. However, while transitioning and resilience are useful descriptors, they can be abstract or conflicting ideals and their meanings obscured by a lack of concrete examples, both being barriers to many planning objectives. In this paper, we hold a lens over key issues in transitioning to resilience in urban areas by outlining emerging challenges that may offer directions towards operationalising how cities might transition to a more resilient future, while ensuring that communities are at the center of the process. The emerging and challenging areas - geospatial ICT, green infrastructure planning, novel design using collaborative responses, climate planning, limiting urban sprawl and short-circuit economic approaches - are explored as viable facets for devising and sustaining urban transition strategies. We conclude with a discussion on the need for developing a synergistic approach in practice to facilitate transition. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The extent to which the 21st century world will be ``sustainable{'' depends in large part on the sustainability of cities. Early ideas on implementing sustainability focused on concepts of achieving stability, practicing effective management and the control of change and growth - a ``fail-safe{''} mentality. More recent thinking about change, disturbance, uncertainty, and adaptability is fundamental to the emerging science of resilience, the capacity of systems to reorganize and recover from change and disturbance without changing to other states - in other words, systems that are ``safe to fail.{''} While the concept of resilience is intellectually intriguing, it remains largely unpracticed in contemporary urban planning and design. This essay discusses the theory of resilience as it applies to urban conditions, and offers a suite of strategies intended to build urban resilience capacity: multifunctionality, redundancy and modularization, (bio and social) diversity, multi-scale networks and connectivity, and adaptive planning and design. The strategies are discussed in the context of resilience theory and sustainability science, and are illustrated with innovative policies, projects, and programs selected from international examples.

AB  - The question of how to transform behaviors, systems, cultures and institutions to move to more sustainable and resilient cities has received increased attention among scholars and decision makers. However, while sustainability and resilience are increasingly becoming core issues for different strands of scholarship, the strategies for affecting change toward more sustainable and resilient urban centers remain elusive. We use a combination of elements from socio-technical transition theory and political ecology and two Latin American cities (Mexico City and Manizales) to suggest a framework for an analysis of urban transitions in Latin America. The two cities were faced with similar triggers and pressures to create sustainability and resilience and each acted within a time of sweeping international movements. In both cases, networks of actors introduced innovative responses to their own particular set of pressures, constraints and opportunities and attempted to expand nature's life-supporting features such as ecosystem and hydrological services, while reducing threats from hazards such as floods. Yet the innovations that took place in the two cities presented very different results with regard to regime transition. Interestingly, Mexico City's success at creating an urban regime change seems to have been based on the use of a top-down approach as it was driven mainly by actors within the existing power structure with access to the power and the resources of an authoritarian state. By contrast, actors in Manizales have been largely outside the power structure and had less success in creating a city-wide transformation. This highlights the importance of power structure dynamics that can promote or prevent transformations from within or impede transformations from without. © 2013.

AB  - We describe the development of a practical tool for urban planning, using innovations in agent-based modelling to reconcile conflicts at the local/neighbourhood level and designed to improve engagement in neighbourhood spatial planning to deliver optimal planning and regeneration solutions. Neighbourhood or `place' is an important factor in deciding social and economic outcomes. Neighbourhood is also increasingly important for urban planning across Europe as communities are at the front-line in developing resilience to anthropogenic and natural shocks. The current financial crisis and public sector austerity measures across Europe represent shocks to local communities that require policymakers to maximize investments and resources delivered to local communities. Communities and citizens can therefore play a bigger role in contributing to the resilience of cities through local neighbourhood planning. However, there is a need to work differently as public and private finances are restricted and communities need to co-produce plans and delivery of services. Co-production can therefore be one contribution to solutions designed to foster resilience and deliver efficient neighbourhood planning and associated services. Co-production in this context requires an open source approach in which producers and consumers can observe viewpoints and react to the implications of simulated outcomes. Whilst there are numerous examples of Planning Support Systems (PSS) designed to assist urban planners there has been no significant progress made in developing a `grounded' approach incorporating `real-time' inputs from users and stakeholders at the neighbourhood level. This paper sets out the principles and objectives of a simulation-based OpenPlan system in which producers and consumers swap roles. This leads to a greater co-production of planning inputs designed to deliver optimal outcomes and more resilient cities.

AB  - Perception about people's behaviour during emergencies defines, to a large extent, the course of planning and resource allocation for community emergency response as well as development of mitigation measures. During the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in the approach to disaster management. A recent trend has been to encourage more community participation as opposed to the top-down approach of the past. It is believed that community participation will bring about a comprehensive and accurate appreciation of people's perception regarding hazards, risk, vulnerability, and resilience, and this research is an attempt to achieve just that. In order to accomplish our goal, we engaged a group of women that would typically fall into the category of "vulnerable group" in a focus group interview setting. The participants were mainly over 40 years old, the majority with little education, unemployed, facing language barriers, of low income, and reliant on public transit. Many participants identified that they lived in the vicinity of rivers, lakes, railways, or power plants, but did not seem to be aware of their exposure to potential threats-indicating a lack of education and awareness. The most common hazards and mitigation measures they were aware of, included floods (including basement flooding), fire, fire alarm, and smoke detectors. Additionally, illness and loneliness were mentioned as factors contributing to their increased vulnerability, hence reduced resiliency. With the help of the focus group members' participation, we were able to discuss the importance of communities being aware of their surroundings, available resources and help, and permit them to voice their concerns in order to be able to cope during emergencies. We trust and hope that more community participation will lead to stronger and more resilient cities. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Ecosystems provide important services that can help people adapt to climate variability and change. Recognizing this role of ecosystems, several international and nongovernmental organizations have promoted an ecosystem-based approach to adaptation. We review the scientific literature related to ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) with forests and trees, and highlight five cases in which forests and trees can support adaptation: (1) forests and trees providing goods to local communities facing climatic threats; (2) trees in agricultural fields regulating water, soil, and microclimate for more resilient production; (3) forested watersheds regulating water and protecting soils for reduced climate impacts; (4) forests protecting coastal areas from climate-related threats; and (5) urban forests and trees regulating temperature and water for resilient cities. The literature provides evidence that EBA with forests and trees can reduce social vulnerability to climate hazards; however, uncertainties and knowledge gaps remain, particularly for regulating services in watersheds and coastal areas. Few studies have been undertaken on EBA specifically, but the abundant literature on ecosystem services can be used to fill knowledge gaps. Many studies assess the multiple benefits of ecosystems for human adaptation or well-being, but also recognize trade-offs between ecosystem services. Better understanding is needed of the efficiency, costs, and benefits, and trade-offs of EBA with forests and trees. Pilot projects under implementation could serve as learning sites and existing information could be systematized and revisited with a climate change adaptation lens. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - Global warming and related climate changes arelikely to significantly increase the weather-related risks facing human settlements, including floods, water and power supply failures and associated economic collapse into "failed cities". Action to help poor urban communities adapt to become more resilient to possible change must therefore be initiated, although to date attention has focused on mitigation rather than adaptation. This paper considers the physical and financial implications for urban areas of the potential impacts of climate variability and change on water resources, illustrated by examples from sub-Saharan Africa, which is likely to be one of the most vulnerable and most affected regions. Water management, which will be particularly affected by climate change, could provide an opportunity to initiate structured adaptation responses. Adaptation costs in the sub-Saharan urban water sector are estimated at between 10 and 20 per cent of current overseas development assistance to the region. This paper suggests that additional funding should be made available in terms of the "polluter pays" principle, and should be channelled through government budgets rather than ring-fenced climate funds. This would help ensure that "climate proofing" is mainstreamed and would be in keeping with current trends in overseas development assistance reflected in the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. © 2007 Sage Publications.

AB  - Urban development has to meet the challenge of establishing adaptation strategies in response to climate change. In view of its potential to regulate urban climates, green infrastructure will assume a critical role in these strategies. In addition to their positive microclimatic effects, as a source of cooling in dense, hot cities urban green spaces can contribute to mitigation. They can operate as carbon sinks or can reduce energy consumption for air conditioning by providing shade by urban trees or roof-top greenery. Thus, urban green spaces should be incorporated as a significant component into both adaptation and mitigation strategies. This paper focuses on the potentials and constraints of various types and structures of urban green spaces and vegetation in influencing climatic conditions in urban areas. It examines the ability of urban green spaces to counter the urban heat island effect and other impacts of climate change. The scientific findings discussed are based on urban vegetation analysis and climate modelling as well as analysis of planning approaches and instruments in German cities. They will be analysed in the context of the future relevance of greens spaces, and within the framework of current urban planning and development mechanisms.

AB  - Recent case studies for individual locations and on individual urban challenges reveal the growing complexity of managing interrelations among population, infrastructure and institutions. Climate change is increasing the pressures on many urban systems and adding to this complexity. Many of the case studies investigating urban dynamics in the light of climate change have chosen narrow, sector-specific approaches. Few projects have built on insights from complexity theory and related bodies of knowledge which are more consistent with the perspective that urban infrastructure systems are tightly coupled with one another and must respond to often subtle, long-term changes of technological, social and environmental conditions. Drawing on that knowledge, and building on insights from previous case studies, this article explores the potential roles of complexity theory in guiding investment and policy decisions in the urban context. Policy and management that are consistent with insights from complexity theory will need to anticipate a wide array of potential trajectories for urban dynamics, identify and implement strategies that are robust under a range of potential developments, continuously innovate the policy-making and management institutions, and intensify the exchange of knowledge between science and society. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The impact of the extreme heat wave that affected Melbourne, Australia, in two distinct phases in January and February 2009 was severe, with 374 (heat) and 173 (bushfire) excess deaths. Whilst the human health issues have been covered in detail in policy and academic arenas, much less attention has been paid to the adverse impacts on urban infrastructure. Analysis of this event, underpinned by participatory actor-based research, has shown that the impacts were experienced disproportionately across different infrastructure types. For water, telecommunications and airports, the impacts were relatively minor and the impact on rail transport and roads (and to a lesser extent, seaports) was of moderate significance, whereas research findings indicate that the electricity sector was found to be the most vulnerable. This paper focuses on the sectors that were worst impacted: electricity, rail and road transport. Commentary identifies the direct and indirect impacts of the heat event, including associated cascading effects, as well as considering actual and potential adaptation responses both before and after the event. Concluding, the authors reflect on the implications of the heat wave for urban resilience, emphasising the crucial importance of understanding the urban environment as a complex and interconnected system. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The analysis and management of flood risk commonly focuses on surface water floods, because these types are often associated with high economic losses due to damage to buildings and settlements. The rising groundwater as a secondary effect of these floods induces additional damage, particularly in the basements of buildings. Mostly, these losses remain underestimated, because they are difficult to assess, especially for the entire building stock of flood-prone urban areas. For this purpose an appropriate methodology has been developed and lead to a groundwater damage simulation model named GRUWAD. The overall methodology combines various engineering and geoinformatic methods to calculate major damage processes by high groundwater levels. It considers a classification of buildings by building types, synthetic depth-damage functions for groundwater inundation as well as the results of a groundwater-flow model. The modular structure of this procedure can be adapted in the level of detail. Hence, the model allows damage calculations from the local to the regional scale. Among others it can be used to prepare risk maps, for ex-ante analysis of future risks, and to simulate the effects of mitigation measures. Therefore, the model is a multifarious tool for determining urban resilience with respect to high groundwater levels. © Author(s) 2012.

AB  - This contribution seeks to place the relationship between mining, housing and welfare in historical perspective in two Southern African countries with long histories of mining activity that continue to have large mining sectors, namely South Africa and Zambia. Mining capitalists and colonial, as well as apartheid, governments tended to resist urban permanence, but they were usually unable to stop it. Economists and social anthropologists, being less conscious than historians of the cyclical nature of mining, have been prone to discount the remarkable tenacity of the Zambian Copperbelt's urban residents in the face of mining downturns. By contrast, very little attention in the literature has been paid to the decline of gold mining in South Africa. In view of the Zambian precedent for urban resilience, it would be unwise to overlook the continuing influence of South African mining on urban settlement in spite of the industry's gradual decline over the last four decades. The patterns of development of new platinum mines in South Africa and new copper mines in Zambia show certain similarities and historical continuities, including a reluctance on the part of mining companies to accept responsibility for the housing and welfare of all their workers and their families. © 2012 The International Society for Diatom Research.

TI  - Decarbonising Australian cities: A new model for creating low carbon, resilient cities

AB  - Australia currently has one of the largest per capita carbon and ecological footprints in the world. It also has a rapidly rising population with significant growth expected into the future. This paper analyses Australia's existing infrastructure and urban form, the carbon implications associated with it, along with the resources needed to sustain this way of life. The paper demonstrates how the current design of Australian cities based on large houses in low density, dispersed suburbs, which are highly car dependent is extremely resource and emission intensive and ultimately unsustainable. It is argued that the large scale, centralised management of resources, based on outdated technologies and compounded by aging infrastructure further exacerbates the problem. If Australia continues under this 'business as usual' scenario, an increase in emissions, along with numerous resource concerns can be expected. The authors contend, therefore, that Australia urgently needs to transform its cities to embrace new low carbon designs and more efficient and resilient urban systems and processes to ensure the long-term viability of Australian cities. A new model for cities is thus proposed, which is based around the concept of decentralized management of resources using new, low carbon technologies that appear to function best at the precinct level. These can help to create more integrated and resilient infrastructure systems within our cities that will greatly improve efficiency. The technologies outlined, however, are dependent on the urban form in that they are only effective and economically viable if sufficient density exists. In the case of Australian cities, this would therefore involve increasing the density in many areas, especially new centres. Adding density has numerous other benefits such as enabling better public transport infrastructure, which will reduce car dependency and the related transported emissions. Using density to transform cities can also improve quality of life by offering more local amenities and better lifestyles.

AD  - NA
AB  - In this era of rapidly urbanising human populations, urban practitioners are under increasing pressure to create resilient and sustainable cities and towns. Urban ecologists currently have a unique opportunity to apply solid, evidence-based research to help create biodiversity-rich and sustainable cities and towns for the future. Unfortunately, there is currently a mismatch between the questions planners, designers and decision-makers are asking urban ecologists that would allow them to improve the biodiversity outcomes in urban areas, and the questions urban ecologists must ask to contribute to the development and application of the science of urban ecology. For a number of reasons, urban ecologists over the past 25 years have primarily focused on describing the patterns of biodiversity in cities and towns using broad, aggregate predictor variables (e.g., distance to city center, land-use, percent cover of impermeable surfaces and vegetation, etc.). We refer to these results as 'low-hanging fruit'. If the discipline of urban ecology is going to provide the necessary information to inform actions to preserve and enhance urban biodiversity, we need to move beyond place-based research, and work towards the development of confirmed generalizations regarding the relationship between the structure and function of urban ecosystems and biodiversity. We propose three essential strategies for achieving this refined understanding: 1) defining the study window to place the study into a broader global context, 2) collecting and using more explicit question-driven measures of the urban condition in order to improve our understanding of urban ecological drivers, as well as recording more detailed ecological responses to provide insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying an observed response, and 3) expanding studies to include multiple cities, regions and countries. These strategies will help to expedite the ability of urban ecology to contribute to the creation of biodiversity-rich, healthy, resilient cities and towns. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Climate change may pose considerable challenges to coastal cities, particularly in low-lying urban deltas. Impacts are, however, associated with substantial uncertainties. This paper studies an uncertainty-robust adaptation strategy: strengthening the resilience of the impacted system. This approach is operationalised for the city of Rotterdam, using literature study, interviews, and a workshop. Potential impacts have been explored using national climate statistics and scenarios and a set of 'wildcards' (imaginable surprises). Sea level rise, particularly in combination with storm surge, and enduring heat and drought are the most relevant potential stresses in the area. These can lead to damage, loss of image, and societal disruption. Unclear responsibilities enhance disruption. 'Resilience principles' made the concept of resilience sufficiently operational for local actors to explore policy options. Useful principles for urban resilience include: homeostasis, omnivory, high flux, flatness, buffering, redundancy, foresight and preparedness/planning, compartmentalisation, and flexible planning/design. A resilience approach makes the system less prone to disturbances, enables quick and flexible responses, and is better capable of dealing with surprises than traditional predictive approaches. Local actors frame resilience as a flexible approach to adaptation that would be more suitable and tailored to local situations than rigid top-down regulations. In addition to a change in policy, it would require a more pro-active mentality among the population. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This main objective of this paper is to present the actual needs in urban regeneration and in improving their resilience and to enhance the role of managing properly the technological changes in sustainable development of towns and cities. Our studies are based on the principles actions sustained by European Union with respect to urban regeneration. Also, this paper will continue our researches regarding peripherality and urban sustainable development by introducing in our work new key elements from Urban Chart of cities. The paper will be based on researches about management of technological changes in urban areas, study, cases and comparative studies between different types of urban regeneration. The results of this paper will be based on a set of recommendations which will can lately be the base of a usefull guideline for regional and local authorities in their effort to improve the urban resilience and to sustain the process of regeneration. Romanian cities continue to face problems regarding infrastructure degradation, a low quality of live and a poor environment quality. We intend through this paper to emphasize this new concept which, by promoting the important role of technological changes and the efficient mnagement of technological changes in urban areas, will corelate aspects of urban sustainable development with principles of urban regeneration. This paper will underline the link between sustainable development and cities management with the role of implementing an integrated approach of urban economical, social and spatial problems. The management of technological changes play an important role in this process through its added value.

AB  - Climate change is one of the greatest challenges in the 21st century. It is likely to bring severe consequences for human life and settlements. Until recently, climate policy focused on mitigation actions, which aim to curb global warming and avoid further climate change. However, the increasing evidences that world's climate is actually changing have led to increase of attention on adaptation actions along with the mitigation ones. Thus, it is now widely recognized that prompt mitigation and adaptation actions are required to tackle the climate problem. Cities can play crucial roles in tackling climate change by means of mitigation and adaptation actions. Firstly, cities contribute much to the causes of climate change in terms of GHG emissions and land use change. Secondly, cities accommodate more than half of the world's population and critical economic activities. Climate change-related events will disturb the lives of a large part of the population and key economic activities. On the other hand, cities can be an essential part of the solution. Inherent advantages of cities like concentration of people, enterprises and infrastructure, are, in fact, opportunities to formulate effective and low-cost solutions. Citywide actions are believed to entail significant potential to address the climate problem. Despite its importance, urban context has still not been adequately addressed in climate change debate. Although the literature on climate change issues in urban context is emerging, a range of policy responses in terms of tangible mitigation and adaptation actions have been developed in many cities. Yet a systematic understanding of these policy responses is missing. This paper aims to point to this gap and contribute to the emerging literature on climate change issues in urban context. Based on review of major works in the field, the paper first provides an overview of most important impacts of climate change on cities, and then discusses the policy responses, which are necessary for transition from today's carbon-emitter and vulnerable cities to future's low-carbon and resilient cities.

AB  - A novel thermally activated transcritical R744 heat pump cycle, which combines the principles of both the reverse Rankine cycle and Brayton cycle has been analysed. The cycle produces simultaneous hot and cold streams at three temperature levels; 60 degrees C for hot water, 40 degrees C for low temperature ambient heating, 10 degrees C for ambient cooling. The cycle has been designed to fulfil the requirements of a flexible `hybrid' trigeneration scheme, where the three energy streams (electricity, heating and cooling) can be matched closely to the user demands - maximising the Energy Utilisation Factor (EUF) of the fuel. Such a system is likely to be used in environmentally resilient cities in either tertiary sector buildings, interconnected residential zones, industry or other large buildings such as hospitals and educational establishments. The cycle is activated using recuperated thermal energy from a gas turbine exhaust stream and under certain operating conditions uses a small proportion of the electricity produced by the gas turbine generator set. Recuperation is achieved using a direct exhaust gas to R744 recuperating heat exchanger. At higher levels of thermal recuperation, the increase in expander inlet temperature results in a substantial increase in the Coefficient Of Performance (COP). With an expander inlet temperature of 250 degrees C the cycle achieves a COP in cooling of 1.13, whilst with a expander inlet temperature of 350 degrees C the cycle achieves a COP in cooling of 1.58. These values of COP in cooling are typical of double and triple stage absorption chillers respectively. The values for COP in heating are 1.97 for an expander inlet temperature of 250 degrees C, and 2.41 for an expander inlet temperature of 350 degrees C. The cycle is also capable of acting as a power positive bottoming cycle, whilst still providing heating and cooling. Under these circumstances, and assuming an expander inlet temperature of 350 degrees C, the cycle has a thermal to mechanical conversion efficiency of 9.7\%. The corresponding values of COP in cooling and heating are 1.03 and 1.80 respectively.

AB  - Urban flood risk is increasing as a consequence of climate change and growing impervious surfaces. Increasing complexity of the urban context, gradual loss of tacit knowledge and decreasing social awareness are at the same time leading to inadequate choices with respect to urban flood risk management (UFRM). The European Flood Risk Directive emphasises the need for non-structural measures aimed at urban resilience and social preparedness. The Three Points Approach (3PA) provides a structure facilitating the decision making processes dealing with UFRM. It helps to accept the complexity of the urban context and promotes transdisciplinarity and multifunctionality. The 3PA introduces three domains wherein water professionals may act and where aspects valued by different stakeholders come into play: (1) technical optimisation, dealing with standards and guidelines for urban drainage systems; (2) spatial planning, making the urban area more resilient to future changing conditions; and (3) day-to-day values, enhancing awareness, acceptance and participation among stakeholders. Based on in-depth interviews conducted in The Netherlands and Denmark, we describe the complexity of decision making in practical UFRM and explain how the 3PA can be used when organising participatory processes. We introduce a theoretical framework characterising the large range of aspects involved in decision making related to UFRM and evaluate the usefulness of the 3PA in dealing with it. We conclude that the 3PA offers water managers and operators an efficient communication tool and thinking system, which helps to reduce complexity to a level suitable when organising strategy plans for UFRM and urban adaptation to climate change. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Coping with mass emergencies and disasters has become a growing challenge for children, adults and entire communities. Among the population groups affected by disaster, children are particularly vulnerable. Responsible disaster intervention requires both top-down and bottom-up preparation that endorses an ecological perspective, taking into consideration the impact upon individuals and families as well as on neighborhoods and entire communities. In such an approach, preventive and post-disaster interventions with children should be integrated with community leadership, local schools, welfare units, social institutions and medical centers. Objective: In this paper we briefly summarize how disaster affects children and their protective matrix. We further discuss the concept of personal and community resilience, its definitions and components. The worldview of this system-oriented approach encompasses perceptions of public health and administration, community capital and resilience and preventive education. Results: We describe what makes a community a resilient one, and the role played by preparedness. Finally, we describe the Cohen-Harris Model of Urban Resilience, its rationale, and its four resilience programs (health/mental health, population, information and school resilience).In this model, the local authority serves as the command center for emergency preparedness and resilience is developed through everyday activities that are an integral part of the urban routine. Conclusions: This model relies on interest in child welfare to enlist leaders, institutions and communities to act as well to motivate the entire community and to implement far-reaching and systemic changes. Interest in all aspects of children's lives serves to integrate the actions of families, organizations and communities. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Two key paradigms emerge out of the variety of urban forms: certain cities resemble trees, others leaves. The structural difference between a tree and a leaf is huge: one is open, the other closed. Trees are entirely disconnected on a given scale: even if two twigs are spatially close, if they do not belong to the same branch, to go from one to the other implies moving down and then up all the hierarchy of branches. Leaves on the contrary are entirely connected on intermediary scales. The veins of a leaf are disconnected on the two larger scales but entirely connected on the two or three following intermediary scales before presenting tiny tree-like structures on the finest capillary scales. Urban system's structural resilience is highest when it is configured according to a scale free structure for its parts and for its connections. The spatial distribution and the intensity of connections in such a structure obeys a scale-free distribution. It states the frequency of an element's appearance and the span of a connection based on its hierarchic level: the smaller an element is, the more often it will be encountered in the system; the bigger an element is the rarer it will be. This fundamental law defines in itself the manner in which living organisms and things should be organized to optimize their access to energy, the use that they make of it, and their resilience. The history of urban planning has evolved from leaf-like to tree-like patterns, with a consequent loss of efficiency and resilience.

AB  - This paper stems from long-lasting research dedicated to urban risk reduction through a planning approach. It focuses on public space, proposing an inversion of the usual perspective: instead of considering public spaces for risk mitigation and urban redevelopment, here the imperatives of environmental safety and urban resilience can be instrumental for exploring the meaning and role of the public space from a different, rather compelling point of view. instrumental for exploring the meaning and role of the public space from a different, rather compelling point of view. One starting point is the concept of SUM, Strategic Urban Structure (or Framework), from the Italian ``Struttura urbana minima{''}, which has been introduced in order to set out the contents of urban risk reduction in local administration agendas and particularly into ordinary planning processes. The SUM has been conceived both as an analytical and a normative/planning tool. Public spaces are the backbone of both urban structure and of the SUM. From their features, localization, distribution within the settlement, and their systemic characters, largely depend the capacity of a town to positively react to a seismic event. Six case-studies of small and medium-size historic towns in the Umbria Region (one of the many Italian Regions with a high level of seismic risk), help to understand the complexities and problems related to seismic prevention within historical centres, and the conflicts between conservation of the heritage and the imperatives of environmental safety. In order to overcome possible criticalities identified in a SUM, it is necessary to provide alternatives to its functioning through redundant elements. The concept of redundancy, which is strictly related to that of uncertainty, is very interesting and promising in this field of research.

By environmental literature conducted recently, it has been evidently comprehended that urban life quality for mankind and others can be improved by serving these systems with green and living elements. This study is to investigate urban rocky habitats that have special natural characteristics and that can be implicated for urban green areas. But these habitats have been considered as nature splits withstanding against the urban pressures by means of the unplanned build-up activities foremost, and road construction, poor quality or neglected remnants. Therefore, this study presents the environmental perception and preferences of urban rocky habitats which are threatening within excessive urbanization and human use of natural areas in the context of the city of Trabzon, Turkey. So, a total of 20 habitats selected from urban and surroundings were surveyed by using a questionnaire and landscape assessment approach. With surveying performed on 204 participants, visual preferences, landscape attributes and proposed management options for urban nature conservation were determined. The χ2-test results revealed clearly that the demographic and expertise status of the participants were correlated with the preferences for types of rocky habitat scene and management options. The scenes with natural elements and less human disturbance obtained higher scores on visual preferences than any of the urban rocky scenes lacking these characteristics. Also, in the quantitative phase, factor analysis based on principal component structure revealed the 'visual and spatial effects', the 'usage and arrangement', the 'naturalness and ecological value', and the 'functionality' components of the scenes. Consequently, some implications for the effective and efficient planning and development of urban nature conservation by assisting the better understanding of the various patterns of landscape preference, choice and satisfaction in habitats under the present study were suggested. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Extreme weather events, such as unusually high or low temperatures, severe winds and heavy precipitation, pose a threat to people and property in cities, and are expected to become more frequent and intense as a result of climate change. Managing this risk requires effective climate adaptation policies - strategic courses of action designed to strengthen urban resilience to climate-related stress. City governments have a key role to play in adaptation policy design, but they appear to face challenges in marshalling political commitment and technical capacity. This article examines elements of urban climate adaptation policy targeting extreme weather and analyzes the policy development process in two major Canadian cities, Toronto and Halifax. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The global environmental situation is in decline, and cities are at the very centre of the problem. This has resulted in an urgent need for a radical and large-scale eco-technological overhaul. This chapter focuses on the paradigm shift towards sustainability and resilience, and particularly, how the new thinking of resilience can convert investments in urban infrastructure and development into resilient support systems, enabling both greater city prosperity and environmental regeneration. The objectives of this chapter are to search for new paths in the creation of resilient communities through the sustainable use of technologies; to discuss the significance of equity, economy, and traditional knowledge in resilient cities; to put forward a green approach that encompasses both mitigation and adaptation; and to explore potential and practical ways of creating urban resilience. A detailed review of existing definitions and policies related to urban resilience, as well as the role of eco-technologies and city planners in this process, is also presented. The chapter concludes by suggesting a set of urban design strategies and a list of key stakeholders as critical ingredients in the move towards urban resilience. © 2014, IGI Global.

AB  - The Rad Resilient City Checklist is a local planning tool that can help save tens of thousands of lives following a nuclear detonation. If prevention of nuclear terrorism fails, then reducing exposure to radioactive fallout is the intervention that can save the most lives following a nuclear detonation. Yet, most Americans are not familiar with correct safety measures against fallout, and many believe that nothing can be done to reduce the suffering and death inflicted by a nuclear attack. Moreover, cities have no checklist on how to prepare the emergency management infrastructure and the larger population for this hazard, despite hundreds of pages of useful guidance from the federal government and radiation professional organizations. The Rad Resilient City Checklist reverses this situation by converting the latest federal guidance and technical reports into clear, actionable steps for communities to take to protect their residents from exposure to radioactive fallout. The checklist reflects the shared judgment of the Nuclear Resilience Expert Advisory Group, a national panel led by the Center for Biosecurity and comprised of government decision makers, scientific experts, emergency responders, and leaders from business, volunteer, and community sectors. © 2013 Health Physics Society.

AB  - Natural hazards threaten the urban system and its components that are likely to fail. With their high degree of interdependency, urban networks and services are critical issues for the resilience of a city. And yet, network managers are scarcely aware of their flaws and dependencies and they are reluctant to take them into account. In order to develop an operational tool to improve urban resilience, we propose here an auto-diagnosis method to be completed by network managers. The subsequent confrontation of all diagnoses is the basis of collaborative research for problem identification and solution design. The tool is experimented with the Parisian urban transport society. © 2012 Author(s) 2012. CC Attribution 3.0 License.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to investigate the efficiency of domestic Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) tank to reduce the inflow discharge to stormwater sewer systems, which intends to be an option to increase urban resilience to climate change impacts. A dimensionless methodology developed based on a water balance model at daily temporal scale was applied to determine both the obtainable water saving due to the use of rain water for toilet flushing (i.e. reduce the use of portable water) and meanwhile reduce stormwater volumes discharging to sewer systems by the tank storage. The methodology and a RWH tank system was evaluated applying the daily rainfall data obtained in two met-stations of Blindern in Oslo and Rygge in Fredrikstad, South Norway. Results show, for all the considered scenarios in the two case studies that the use of the rainwater storage tank can provide significant reduction of water volume discharges to the storm water sewer, accordingly the resulting damages during the extreme events will be reduced. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AD  - NA
AB  - This chapter deals with a paradigm shift in urban planning regarding flood risks against the background of climate change. Therefore it describes the history of Hamburg's urban development visions and strategies resulting recently in the vision of "Metropolis Hamburg -Growing City". This contains the concept of a "Leap over the River Elbe" that connects the city center north of the Elbe with former industrial areas south of the river. Consequently, the chapter explores the so-called "Elbinsel", the huge island of Wilhelmsburg situated within the river Elbe, where about 50 000 people live on 100 km2 with wide parts being below sea level. In recent years the awareness of climate change has arisen and has forced the need for new strategies of risk management. New adaptation strategies go along with the planning paradigm "living with water" that includes more flexible ways of urban planning in addition to flood protection by dikes. Therefore the chapter presents an innovative flood protection concept -the system of cascading flood compartments -dealing with storm surges and sea level rise. The conclusion of the chapter focuses on the reflection of the system of cascading flood compartments in the context of adaptive capacity.

AB  - New Orleans have coped with natural disasters since its founding over 290 years ago, but the most destructive and damaging was Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, both a natural and a man-made disaster. Katrina, the resultant flooding and New Orleans' subsequent on-going recovery demonstrate that the management of flood risk must incorporate new concepts like urban resilience in the city's planning process. The goal of this project is to assess if resilience and related flood mitigation programs have been incorporated into the recovery of New Orleans post-Katrina. We focus on the performance of one particular city neighborhood (Oak Park) within the greater area known as Gentilly. The assessment of Oak Park's urban resilience is made by comparing its' pre and post Katrina condition. A methodology was developed for modeling failure mechanisms by using two operational safety methods: functional analysis as well as a failure mode and effect analysis. When applied to individual neighborhoods, these methods allow failure mechanisms to be modeled as scenarios. In New Orleans' post-Katrina recovery, a strong emphasis has been placed on improving the flood performance of buildings and protective systems but other components and vital functions of the neighborhood have not yet been fully considered.

AB  - Cities of our area are faced with a raising competition from globalization, as well as with the impact of a systemic crisis that questions some previous growth models. Along with the aim of increasing the effort of economic and social innovation, is important now to use these strategies to overcome the shrinkage of some cities. Although most studies on innovation, knowledge or creativity have been focused on large cities and metropolitan areas, the medium-sized cities shows a growing interest, both from the perspective on territorial cohesion as to provide recent examples of cities that have surpassed decline processes through innovative strategies. This paper provides a theoretical reflection on the concepts of innovative city and urban resilience, identifies its main features, presents the keys factors to explain the uneven paths of medium-sized cities and propose policies to promote urban innovation.

Resilience is de- stroyed by fear, which causes us to panic, reduces our inner resolve, and eventually debilitates our bodies. Resilience is built on hope, which gives us confidence and strength. Hope is not blind to the possibility of everything getting worse, but it is a choice we make when faced with challenges.

VL  - 
IS  - NA
PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - A major cause of increasing flood risk of cities is the increasing population and value of domestic and commercial buildings and growing interdependency on infrastructure networks. Contemporary flood risk analyses generally include only direct economic damages and fail to consider other flood risks, such as disruption to the economy or the loss of life, which may be mitigated by building resilience into high value assets, critical infrastructure systems and urban communities. The infrastructure networks are critical for the continuity of economic activities as well as for the people's basic living needs. Resilience in cities depends both on its physical form and characteristics as well as on the people's capacity, and social behavior. There is a growing recognition that innovative planning approaches and processes based on these resilience principles will guide citizens and other stakeholders the way to become co-producers of a sustainable community that can respond to change and disruption, and pro-actively reduce vulnerabilities. In most industrialized countries, the building stock and infrastructure are mainly ageing and there is much heritage. In the coming decades, the redevelopment (c.f. renovation and modernization) of the existing stock is a high priority and certainly of higher priority than the provision of new housing. Redevelopment projects may thus provide windows of opportunity to make adjustments in the process of urban renewal in order to correct old mistakes and to build resilience by adapting and restructuring the urban fabric to new conditions of increased flood risk. Some cities in the developing world, however, is not often constrained by significant past investments, and much of the change in their urban fabric is to come in the next few decades. There is a huge challenge to exploit this momentum. If we are able to seize these windows of opportunity and share good practices via city-to-city networks stretching across country boundaries and other social networks, than we can create the groundswell for real practical change towards flood-resilient cities at a global level. This can convert the challenge into an opportunity. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the year 2003, the Stockholm Urban Assessment (SUA) was selected as a sub-global assessment within the global Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA, Ecosystems and human well-being: synthesis. Island Press, Washington, DC, 2005). This chapter revisits SUA and fi lls in important knowledge gaps in the assessment as well as provides insights on urban resilience building. The chapter applies a critical perspective on the present urban development trajectory of the Stockholm metropolitan area. It emphasizes the need to understand ways in which informally managed green spaces contribute to ecological functions in urban settings. The chapter provides a background of the Stockholm region and the current challenges it faces, followed by a synthesis of the major insights conveyed in SUA related to informal ecosystem management. The chapter concludes by proposing policy recommendations of general implications for urban resilience building. © 2013, Springer Netherlands. All rights reserved.

VL  - 6
IS  - NA
PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - The paper argues that creative destruction at the heart of capitalist dynamics, along with risk-prone features of neoliberalism, impedes wide-ranging resilience. A form of resilience focusing narrowly on natural and human-caused disasters replaces broader responses to risks, which address economic and personal hardship. Concurrently, combined effects of neoliberal societal arrangements and economic globalization exacerbate economic risks to which individuals and communities are exposed. A discussion of the shrinking city phenomenon demonstrates that economic hazards, against which most resilience measures are helpless, represent a peril that is more common than, and often at least as destructive as, the disasters targeted by mainstream resilience approaches. The experience of shrinking cities points to the dual impact of their contracting economies: direct threats to the wellbeing and survival of their residents, and a depletion of the intervention capacity of agencies responsible for different aspects of urban resilience. The paper closes with an examination of realistic means of enhancing resilience in the present neoliberal context. © Author(s) 2014.

AB  - This essay explores two antonimic approaches adopted by planning to describe food production and supply systems deeply rooted in local communities. The first is based on the concept of a 'foodshed' and puts the accent on sustainability and 'resilience', while the second refers to the notion of 'terroir', with the emphasis on oneness and the intrinsic value of locally produced food. Through a reading of English and Italian case histories, the essay critically analyses the two approaches, their feasibility and the different results achieved in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The analysis is organised in two sections, each of which introduces the case history with a brief theoretical introduction. In the conclusions, the antynomy between the two approaches is re-examined and possible research developments on the subject are identified. Copyright © FrancoAngeli.

PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - Peak oil and climate destabilization are combining in this century to create a perfect storm which threatens the human prospect now and for all future time. This chapter surveys four scenarios for the future as we face this crisis of crises: (1) civilizational collapse, (2) sustainable enclaves for the wealthy, (3) urban deconstruction and re-ruralization, and (4) a meta-industrial society comprised of resilient cities and sustainable bioregions. While all four scenarios are likely to be simultaneously present in the decades ahead, it is argued that only the meta-industrial vision is capable of inspiring the thought and action necessary for us to change our direction and respond creatively and effectively to the great challenges of our time. Based on the principles of tolerance and cooperative community and supported by the intelligent use of environmentally and humanly appropriate technology, the meta-industrial society is comprised of resilient and sustainable human settlements. The characteristics of resilient and sustainable cities are defined and illustrated by a case study of the sustainable urban district of Kronsberg (Hannover), Germany. It is concluded that the only way to create an equitable, socially just, and environmentally sustainable human ecology is to integrate social policy and environmental policy into a seamless whole that results in the creation of new communities such as Kronsberg and the transformation of existing metropolitan areas into a polycentric pattern of mixed-use, humanly scaled, resilient cities and regenerative agricultural landscapes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

JO  - NA
PY  - 2013
VL  -

PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - Two different (yet tiglitly connected and complementary) wide issues appear to crisscross in this research. The first one is the general question of urban resilience, assumed in its relational meaning: the capacity of an urban system, thanks to the features of its spatial elements, to take abruptly imposed transformations, without significantly changing their mutual relations and hence the whole urban geography: and the transformation imposed by an earthquake (its destruction as well as the successive reconstruction) are undoubtedly sudden and abrupt. A discussion will hence be aimed at determining some configurational parameters, suitable for reproducing the capability of a spatial system to sustain sudden changes and yet to retain its inner working mechanisms. The second theme more specifically concerns the matter of earthquakes, and will here be aimed at investigating the effect of a seismic event on the inner geography of an urban settlement, thus verifying on several case studies the effects of an earthquake as well as the reliability of space syntax to describe their actual resilience. Summing all up, this paper aims at pinpointing the configurational features, if any, suitable for reproducing and accounting for the level of resilience a settlement is provided with, and -afterwards - at testing them on urban cases actually affected by earthquake destructions. The main case study here assumed is the settlement of L'Aquila, in Italy, with reference to the devastating earthquake of April, 6th 2009. The configuration analysis has been applied to the spatial consistencies respectively referred to three distinct phases: - before the earthquake; - soon after the earthquake (temporary, but still present situation); - after the earthquake, definitive (yet distant to come) situation, including the forthcoming reconstruction of the perished areas and the new development areas (at L'Aquila, the so-called 'CASE' project). Some significant outcome can be drawn. First, this approach allows highlighting the dramatic transformation an earthquake, like other natural disasters, is likely to cause to the inner geography of a settlement, upsetting the distribution of movement flows and the levels of attractiveness and centrality. Even more, the configurational analysis will reveal the likely effects the reconstruction and rehabilitation plans and projects on the variables of the urban system, over and above the fulfilment of recovery claim and the housing supplying. More in general, it will report the far-reaching and long-lasting relevance of urban plans worked out in emergency situation, under the pressure of need and urgency. On such basis, the method is here proposed as a suitable tool for supporting and orienting the temporary (yet often enduring) post-earthquake phase as well as the successive reconstruction planning.

AB  - Urbanized delta areas worldwide share a growing tendency of exposure to water stress induced by the effects of climate change and anthropogenic factors, threatening the operation of infrastructure systems and future urban development. The important synergistic impacts coexisting with freshwater scarcity are increasing urbanization rates, subsiding soils, saltwater intrusion in aquifers and rivers, coastal erosion, and increased flooding. Innovative design strategies and concepts for the integration of decentralized rainwater management measures can contribute to the integrated and climate resilient planning of urban spaces that are threatened by climate change scenarios that worsen the security of urban infrastructures and the future availability of fresh water. Decentralized rainwater management, including retention, storage, and reuse strategies that are integrated into spatial planning and urban design, can reduce flood risks while simultaneously enhancing freshwater availability. This paper discusses a paradigm shift in urban water management, from centralized to decentralized management (that is, from threats to opportunities), using the example of two case studies. Concepts and strategies for building climate resilient cities, which address flood control, the protection of freshwater resources, and the harmonization of a natural and more sustainable water balance, are presented for Almere (Rhine Schelde Delta, The Netherlands) and Hsingchu (Dotzpu Delta, Taiwan). © 2013 by the authors;.

AD  - NA
AB  - Climate change governance is increasingly being conducted through urban climate change experiments, purposive interventions that seek to reconfigure urban sociotechnical systems to achieve low-carbon and resilient cities. In examining how experiments take effect, we suggest that we need to understand not only how they are made and assembled, but also how they are maintained within specific urban contexts. Drawing on literatures from urban political ecology and the specific debate on urban repair and maintenance, this article examines maintenance in two case studies of climate change experiments in housing in Bangalore (India) and Monterrey (Mexico). We find that maintenance is a crucial process through which not only urban obduracy is preserved, but also the novel and innovative character of the experiment is asserted and reproduced. The process of 'maintaining' experiments is a precarious one, which requires a continuous external input in terms of remaking the experiment materially and discursively. This process causes further reconfigurations beyond the experiment, changing the patterns of responsibility attribution and acceptability that configure the urban fabric. © 2013 Urban Research Publications Limited.

AD  - NA
AB  - This article discusses urban conditions in cities that in their recent history experienced war. It puts the social component of the city into relationship with the destroyed and dangerous urban environment. In the period between 1992 and 1996 in Sarajevo and in other Bosnian cities, survival became the most important activity for citizens. In the period directly preceding the war, urban conditions—mobility, infrastructure, and services—started to malfunction. As a result, ordinary city life became an object of new urban imageries influenced by new urban conditions and rules of behavior. The first bombing of the city on 6 April 1992 was a sign that the war had started. It brought with it war urban conditions: lack of public transport, electricity, water, and food. The inability of the city and the people living in it to function normally demanded new patterns of urban resilience, which were partly a product of the city’s prewar conditions. Using Sarajevo as a case study, this article examines whether the city had predisaster coping strategies and, if so, the extent to which these plans were used during the war. Finally, the article observes how citizens, with their own imageries about cities, can participate in the creation of patterns of urban resilience and future predisaster strategies. © 2012, The Author(s).

AB  - Since cities formed, either men or nature has destroyed them through out history. However, they were always rebuilt and rebounded. After about 1800, such resilience became a nearly universal fact of urban settlement around world. Urban disaster takes many forms and can be categorized in many ways, like scale of destruction, human troll, natural disasters and etc. Because of these kinds of disasters, the cities need to be resilient and need to adapt upcoming conditions. Although there are many different forms of disasters, this study is more concerned about the ones that are caused by humans and that can be prevented or at least with the ones which something still can be done about. In other words, this study is about importance of resilient cities and adapting existing cities to the future. This research is about energy efficient buildings, clean and renewable energy resources, improved transportation options, reduced waste and industrial pollution and adapting to new conditions so that cities can be sustainable and their residents can continue their urban life without extreme shocks and stresses. While studying resilience and adaptation, Chicago Metropolitan Area will be the case study. Chicago?s main struggle begins with the Great Fire in 1871, and continues with Great Depression in 1930. The World War II effects and still continues with problems that are caused by people?s modern lifestyle, like heat islands or greenhouse gas emissions. For more than fifteen years, Chicago has been promoting the transformation into an environmentally friendly city. From green roofs to recycling, Chicago continues to take steps toward resiliency against climate change. Currently, not only the local government but also the business community and residents at large have engaged in a multitude of key partnerships and efforts to support the city?s goal. Scientists, businesses and governments around the world agree: climate change is one of the most serious issues facing the Earth today. In the last 50 years, levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have risen 25 percent; levels of methane, an even more potent greenhouse gas, have more than doubled. Because of these increases in heat-trapping gases, under a high-emissions scenario, recent predictions show that by the end of the century, annual average temperature could increase up to four degrees Celsius, and every single part of the Earth will be affected with climate change. Developed countries started to take action against climate change. They are developing strategies that can be applied by even developing countries, such as Turkey, and surely these strategies can be used as a road map to strength Turkish cities against incoming climate change.

Indeed, we argue that local authorities lack technical skills, organizational powers and resilience culture in promoting an integrated management though the latest French and European strategies are pushing in this direction. Given this context, the Resilis project, funded by the French National Research Agency and lead by Egis, aims at providing a new offer for municipalities willing to assess and improve their territory's resilience.

AB  - Holding a population of 15 million people, Istanbul is the biggest city of Turkey. Ensured by its unique location, Istanbul has always been a remarkable coastal city, throughout its long history dating back to 660 BC. Today this unique location poses a threat to the city. Under the Sea of Marmara, tectonic plates move on one of the most active geologic boundaries in the world, named as the North Anatolian Fault. Existing in an earthquake prone area, the city will probably confront a major earthquake within two decades time. Scientific studies and Earthquake Master Plan for Istanbul highlight the disaster vulnerability of megacity. Today, cities need to improve themselves to resilient ones in order to cope with the challenges of 21st century. This study is an attempt to reveal the power of landscape planning for building this resiliency. Regarding their proximity to the earthquake fault line, southern coastal districts of Istanbul are subject to several earthquake risk analysis and hazard assessments. However, required disaster mitigation studies are still lacking for most of the coastal districts. Seeking to reveal the power of landscape planning in disaster mitigation, this study is utilizing GIS technology and focusing on one of the most significant hazard prone coastal districts of Istanbul called Kadiköy. Due to its dense built space structure, close proximity to the fault line, 3 major urban streams and coastal landfills, Kadiköy is a vulnerable coastal district to the impacts of the major earthquake and the accompanying secondary disasters such as tsunami, liquefaction, landslide and fire. Within this study, mitigation capacities of open spaces are evaluated according to nine major parameters which are ownership, interaction with the secondary hazards, slope, land cover, size, accessibility, perceptibility, provision of technical infrastructure and proximity to sociocultural infrastructures. These analyses indicate that major public open spaces of Kadiköy district cannot be utilized for the social benefit during the post-earthquake period as they are located on tsunami hit areas or along the riverfronts. However, this study proves that it is possible to improve existing green structure of Kadiköy district and utilize the green structure for the purposes of evacuation, gathering and sheltering. Today, there is an urgent need for turning Istanbul into a disaster resilient city. This study highlights the importance of disaster sensitive landscape planning for building disaster resiliency, regarding the benefit of Istanbul megacity and the other hazard prone cities.

AB  - There is a growing recognition of the need for daily contact with nature, to live happy, productive, meaningful lives. Recent attention to biophilic design among architects and designers acknowledges this power of nature. However, in an increasingly urban planet, more attention needs to be aimed at the urban scales, at planning for and moving towards what the authors call "biophilic cities". Biophilic cities are cities that provide close and daily contact with nature, nearby nature, but also seek to foster an awareness of and caring for this nature. Biophilic cities, it is argued here, are also sustainable and resilient cities. Achieving the conditions of a biophilic city will go far in helping to foster social and landscape resilience, in the face of climate change, natural disasters and economic uncertainty and various other shocks that cities will face in the future. The paper identifies key pathways by which biophilic urbanism enhances resilience, and while some are well-established relationships, others are more tentative and suggest future research and testing. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Drawing on, and integrating, emerging theories and practices of urban resilience, this article charts the emergence and progression of different 'waves' of resilience policy in the UK. Specifically, it argues that changing practices of resilience have emerged both as a function of time, and in relation to a range of changing socio-political and economic pressures, which have re-articulated the meaning, scale, operational role of, and responsibility for, resilience. The article seeks to critique resilience policy, raising questions about the usefulness of emerging resilience as the central organising concept for depicting how urban systems respond to contemporary and future crises. © 2013 Political Studies Association.

AB  - Nexus security is a compound mix of ideas: reconciling human needs and wants with access to multiple resources; diversity of access to those resources and services; resilience in the face of weather- and climaterelated variability; resilience likewise in the face of infrastructure failure; and the personal, individual sense of belonging. At the level of Systems Thinking there is a very close relationship between resilience in the behavior of natural (ecological) systems and resilience in the social dynamics of governance within communities, where such resilience establishes the viability of these communities over centuries, which in turn entails successful stewardship of the man-environment relationship. We use insights from this cross-system mapping - across natural, built, and human systems - to assess, first, the role of city governance in achieving nexus security (or not) and, second, the role of technological innovations in serving the same purpose. More specifically, eight principles, covering resilience and diversity of access to resources and services, are used to gauge security-enhancing features of city buildings and infrastructure. Case studies include new designs of resilient office blocks, nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) recovery systems for sanitation and wastewater treatment, and the reconstruction of urban parks for the provision of ecosystem services. Throughout the paper, matters of risk in the face of meteorological variability are prominent. We do not conclude, however, that the presence of risk implies nexus insecurity. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A lot of large disasters frequently occur all over the world. In such a risky society, risk management is absolutely necessary, in particular for modern China as a biggest developing country. This paper firstly discusses the concept of urban resilience whose goal is to shape "culture of resilience" to the largest extent to reduce urban risk. Urban resilience includes wide and diverse sides such as engineering, physical, and social-economic dimensions. Secondly, summarizing the legislation system and current programs for Chinese urban resilience, it is found that Chinese central governments are paying more and more attentions to urban resilience through a lot of legislations and programs even if not using the same words. Thirdly and finally, the work to improve urban resilience has to be done step by step, little by little through the efforts of all people by introducing one practice of resilient city planning in Shenzhen city, China. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.

First, the intention is to discuss how well equipped contemporary planning theory and practice is in preparing urban areas to face the new conditions that have resulted from the neoliberal spatial agenda in an increasingly borderless world and its ability to address the escalating numbers of hazards, most of which are triggered by rising levels of consumption. Second, it aims to discuss the characteristics of a new theoretical approach to planning that may assist in the creation of resilient cities that are able to adapt to both slow changes and major pressures. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Cities can be seen as complex systems of heterogeneous processes with a high variety of different influences (e.g. social, infrastructural, economic, and political impacts). This especially applies for tasks concerning urban development of existing assets. The optimization of traffic flows, reduction of emissions, improvement of energy efficiency, but also urban climate and landscape planning issues require the involvement of many different actors, balancing different perspectives, and divergent claims. The increasing complexities of planning and decision processes make high demands on professionals of various disciplines, government departments, and municipal decision-makers. In the long term, topics like urban resilience, energy management, risk and resource management have to be taken into account and reflected in future projects, but always related to socio-spatial and governmental aspects. Accordingly, it is important to develop models to be able to understand and analyze the outcomes and effects of governmental measures and planning to the urban environment. Thus, a more systematic approach is needed - going away from well-defined city models to city system models. The purpose is to describe urban processes not only quantitatively, but to grasp their qualitative complexity and interdependencies, by modeling and simulating existing urban systems. This contribution will present the City System Model (CSM) concept closely related to an Urban Energy Planning use case, will highlight the methodology, and focus on first results and findings from an ongoing interdisciplinary research project and use case to improve the basis of information for decision-makers and politicians about urban planning decisions. © 2013 Copernicus.

AB  - Creating a resilient urban matrix has become a fundamental issue due to natural and human caused disasters, economic and ecological crises last few decades. Subsequently, integrating productivity in cities via landscape and planning tools and developing a sustainable infrastructure become inevitable. This study explores the role of productive landscapes in creating resilient cities. More specifically, the paper focuses on urban agriculture as one of the major components of productive landscapes. Pioneering models of productive landscapes and urban agriculture go back to 19th century with the works of Ebenezer Howard, Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Right, and Ian McHarg. Obviously, cities have been blended with nature for centuries; the only difference now is that industrialization has made food production invisible. Istanbul is presented as the case study. Through the rich history of Istanbul, food has a strong influence on city's image. It is still possible to see the traces of agricultural uses along the Theodesian Walls, and some old neighborhoods. Some foresighted organizations and individuals promote agriculture in inner urban areas. However, dealing with rapid urbanization problems, agricultural lands have been transformed into settlement areas in time. As we are in the age of sustainability, combining agriculture with the new technology and recent architectural trends as well as sustainable master plans incorporating productive landscape concepts will encourage urban agriculture in the city, hence creating more resilient urban environments.

PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - A novel thermally activated transcritical R744 heat pump cycle, which combines the principles of both the reverse Rankine cycle and Brayton cycle has been analysed. The cycle produces simultaneous hot and cold streams at three temperature levels; 60°C for hot water, 40°C for low temperature ambient heating, 10°C for ambient cooling. The cycle has been designed to fulfil the requirements of a flexible 'hybrid' trigeneration scheme, where the three energy streams (electricity, heating and cooling) can be matched closely to the user demands - maximising the Energy Utilisation Factor (EUF) of the fuel. Such a system is likely to be used in environmentally resilient cities in either tertiary sector buildings, interconnected residential zones, industry or other large buildings such as hospitals and educational establishments. The cycle is activated using recuperated thermal energy from a gas turbine exhaust stream and under certain operating conditions uses a small proportion of the electricity produced by the gas turbine generator set. Recuperation is achieved using a direct exhaust gas to R744 recuperating heat exchanger. At higher levels of thermal recuperation, the increase in expander inlet temperature results in a substantial increase in the Coefficient Of Performance (COP). With an expander inlet temperature of 250°C the cycle achieves a COP in cooling of 1.13, whilst with a expander inlet temperature of 350°C the cycle achieves a COP in cooling of 1.58. These values of COP in cooling are typical of double and triple stage absorption chillers respectively. The values for COP in heating are 1.97 for an expander inlet temperature of 250°C, and 2.41 for an expander inlet temperature of 350°C. The cycle is also capable of acting as a power positive bottoming cycle, whilst still providing heating and cooling. Under these circumstances, and assuming an expander inlet temperature of 350°C, the cycle has a thermal to mechanical conversion efficiency of 9.7%. The corresponding values of COP in cooling and heating are 1.03 and 1.80 respectively. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.

AB  - Human beings today are increasingly urbanites. At the same time, human health and security in urban areas are increasingly under threat from extreme water conditions (e.g., floods and droughts) that are projected to become much more frequent with changing climate. One of the major challenge areas for adapting our growing cities to the extreme climatic variations is the sectoral and fragmented approaches through which cities are planned and developed. To a large extent, it seems that the cross-scale linkages are neglected, and the disjuncture between knowledge and action remains a major barrier for genuine progress toward resilient cities. The WASH & RESCUE initiative (WAter, Sanitation and Hygiene in RESilient Cities and Urban areas adapting to Extreme waters) is a response to the above challenges. Funded by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency and implemented by the Stockholm Environment Institute with partners around the world, the research initiative aims to assess risks in urban context with focus on water, sanitation, and human health, developing preventative actions to enhance adaptive capacity through social learning. The project will examine multiple scales - river basin, city, and technical systems - interactions in various social, ecological and cultural contexts through case studies guided by a resilience perspective. The key impact areas targeted by the initiative are 1) understanding risk, with focus on assessment approaches integrating the water, sanitation, hygiene and health aspects; 2) dealing with and reducing risk, with focus on the available preventative measures and actions; and 3) bridging knowledge to action through social learning.

AB  - Cities are complex and interdependent systems, extremely vulnerable to threats from both natural hazards and terrorism. Urbanization is also a complex dynamic process playing out over multiple scales of space and ime. Virtually all of the world's future population growth is predicted to take place in cities and their urban landscapes - the UN estimates a global increase from the current 2.9 billion urban residents to a staggering 5.0 billion by 2030. Local resiliency with regard to disasters means that a locale is able to withstand an extreme natural event without suffering devastating losses, damage, diminished productivity, or quality of life and without a large amount of assistance from outside the community. Resilience is defined as "the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and re-organize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity and feedbacks". Vulnerability is the flip side of resilience: when a social or ecological system loses resilience it becomes vulnerable to change that previously could be absorbed, For resilience, we need to start not with what's missing but whit what's already there. At this article is tried to determine different conceptual models and frameworks of resilient communities. We also compare these models and frameworks and consider their components and dimensions, Then, we consider social and cultural dimensions and components of resilience in these models and then define proper dimension of social and cultural resiliencein Islamic Cities.

IS  - NA
PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - Zoning has been a powerful force in shaping the three-dimensional landscape of the urban built environment. Although market forces and private interests have historically controlled the decision-making process, land-use regulations have been used to counter market failures and to collectively guide the growth of the American city. During the second half of the nineteenth century, advancements in construction and building technologies, including the steel structural frame, internal pneumatic and telegraphic communications, efficient mechanical systems, and improved fireproofing materials and techniques, allowed for the construction of structures of increasing height. As tall building construction flourished in major U.S. cities, issues of light, ventilation, and public health, as well as encroachment of incompatible uses, began to capture the public's attention. Where tenement reform laws had addressed residential overcrowding, owners, architects, and public officials viewed building regulations as a means to minimize the negative impacts of increasingly massive structures on surrounding property values and public space. This article discusses the evolution of zoning and its implications for the form of cities and suburbs by tracing the history of New York's first comprehensive zoning law. It first presents the economic, social, and technological forces leading to calls for regulation of the built environment and then examines the passage of the 1916 Zoning Resolution as it related to issues of public health, separation of uses, and real estate economics. Finally, the article explores the effect of zoning on the growth of the New York region, focusing on its impact on urban form and the spatial patterns of development and its relationship to emerging issues of environmental sustainability and urban resilience. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

VL  - 11
IS  - NA
PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - Urban systems, with the overall fluxes of energy, water, material, and wastes, can be modeled with a range of metabolic processes. To quantify the urban metabolism, we use the "emergy" assessment method (all materials and energy are transformed to solar energy equivalents) and then present a group of urban metabolic indicators, which quantify urban metabolic balance, capacity, and outputs to assess a city's metabolic efficiencies. In this paper, we use 31 Chinese cities as a sample to illustrate how the model can be operated to evaluate the urban metabolism by emergy analysis. Our results indicate that metropolises and coastal cities were more metabolically efficient with higher metabolic balance, capacities, and outputs; but with more external dependency on imported resources. Central and western cities had lower metabolic efficiencies, with a high ratio of non-renewable emergy reliance. Policy implications highlight the need for renewable energy sources and improved management of imported services, goods, and fuels to achieve higher urban resilience and sustainability.

AB  - New Orleans has coped with natural disasters since it is founding, but the most destructive was Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, both a natural and a man-made disaster. The resultant flooding demonstrates that the management of flood risk must incorporate new concepts like urban resilience in the city's planning process. The goal is to assess if resilience have been incorporated into the recovery of New Orleans post-Katrina, particularly of one city neighborhood: Oak Park. The assessment of Oak Park's urban resilience was made by comparing its pre and post Katrina conditions. A methodology was developed for modeling failure mechanisms by using two operational safety methods: a functional analysis and a failure mode and effect analysis. In New Orleans' post-Katrina recovery, a strong emphasis has been placed on improving the flood performance of buildings and protective systems but other components and vital functions of the neighborhood have not been fully considered. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.

PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - We describe the development of a practical tool for urban planning, using innovations in agent-based modelling to reconcile conflicts at the local/neighbourhood level and designed to improve engagement in neighbourhood spatial planning to deliver optimal planning and regeneration solutions. Neighbourhood or 'place' is an important factor in deciding social and economic outcomes. Neighbourhood is also increasingly important for urban planning across Europe as communities are at the front-line in developing resilience to anthropogenic and natural shocks. The current financial crisis and public sector austerity measures across Europe represent shocks to local communities that require policymakers to maximize investments and resources delivered to local communities. Communities and citizens can therefore play a bigger role in contributing to the resilience of cities through local neighbourhood planning. However, there is a need to work differently as public and private finances are restricted and communities need to co-produce plans and delivery of services. Co-production can therefore be one contribution to solutions designed to foster resilience and deliver efficient neighbourhood planning and associated services. Coproduction in this context requires an open source approach in which producers and consumers can observe viewpoints and react to the implications of simulated outcomes. Whilst there are numerous examples of Planning Support Systems (PSS) designed to assist urban planners there has been no significant progress made in developing a 'grounded' approach incorporating 'real-time' inputs from users and stakeholders at the neighbourhood level. This paper sets out the principles and objectives of a simulation-based OpenPlan system in which producers and consumers swap roles. This leads to a greater coproduction of planning inputs designed to deliver optimal outcomes and more resilient cities. © 2012 IEEE.

PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - In order to withstand disturbances triggered by climate change, natural hazards or simply power cut, the technical networks need to be resilient. The resilience of a system is defined as the ability to absorb a disturbance and then recover its functions. Applied to the technical networks, the concept of resilience enables an integrated approach from the conception to the management. Taking into account possible disruptions, planning for the continuity of the service and tackling critical points involve many stakeholders who must collaborate to ensure the sustainability of the system. We are currently developing a method to raise awareness of network managers and local authorities in the relevance of improving resilience. It is based on an auto-diagnosis made to highlight (1) interdependencies between systems: water, power, but also telecommunications or transports and (2) the effects of the disruption of one or more systems on the others. The portrait of the system leads the managers to think about possible disturbances, impacts on the system, counter-measures and adaptability. Then all actors are gathered for a collaborative session where they can discuss their interdependencies: which system is dependent on which system? Which resources are necessary to the systems operating? Are the managers taking these dependencies into account? Could they plan for a better management of those networks? This tool is tested with the City of Paris in order to assess the resilience of technical networks in the perspective of the "100 year" floods, so that Paris can be more resilient and sustainable.

VL  - 4

PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to add a new dimension to urban resilience by exploring how representations of disasters, reconstruction and human settlements are made, and how, by shaping plans and programs, they ultimately influence resilience. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on James Scott's notion of "legibility" to ask how different representations simplify complex realities and how they are transformed into plans and programs. The paper first outlines the various broad analytic lens used to examine legibility to portray post-disaster reconstruction, drawing on international literature and policies. The paper then focuses on post-earthquake Haiti and analyzes eight reconstruction plans and reviews design proposals submitted for the Building Back Better Communities program to explore how different stakeholders portrayed the disaster, identified the reconstruction challenges and proposed to address human settlements. Findings: Representations of the disaster, the reconstruction challenge and the housing problem were quite varied. While the plans assumed a very broad view of the reconstruction challenge (one that goes beyond the representations found in the literature), the BBBC program adopted a very narrow view of it (one that the literature condemns for failing to achieve sustainable resilience). Research limitations/implications: The empirical research is exploratory, suggesting an approach that throws a new light on the analysis of plans and programs for improved resilience. Practical implications: The study suggests that the representations that decision makers, institutions and organizations make of the world ultimately establish the framework in which resilience is constructed. Originality/value: The lens of legibility confirms that the expression of different representations makes the world legible in different ways and therefore transforms the way in which resilience can be improved. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The construction and service of urban infrastructure systems and buildings involves immense resource consumption. Cities are responsible for the largest component of global energy, water, and food consumption as well as related sewage and organic waste production. Due to ongoing global urbanization, in which the largest sector of the global population lives in cities which are already built, global level strategies need to be developed that facilitate both the sustainable construction of new cities and the re-development of existing urban environments. A very promising approach in this regard is the decentralization and building integration of environmentally sound infrastructure systems for integrated resource management. This paper discusses such new and innovative building services engineering systems, which could contribute to increased energy efficiency, resource productivity, and urban resilience. Applied research and development projects in Germany, which are based on integrated system approaches for the integrated and environmentally sound management of energy, water and organic waste, are used as examples. The findings are especially promising and can be used to stimulate further research and development, including economical aspects which are crucial for sustainable urban (re-)development. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - Urban resilience is a new approach in urban development and risk management that focuses on disturbance absorption and functions recovery. Urban resilience is then based on urban services which support the cities functions and yet, display several critical issues in risk management. When considered as socio-technical systems in which physical network and governance are interacting, urban services are subject to continuity issues, mainly because of interdependencies. We propose here a collaborative method to help managers identify both technical and organizational dependencies so that they can share a common representation of the urban system and discuss its global resilience. The Parisian transportation system (RATP) illustrates the first part of the method: the auto-diagnosis tool to identify and prioritize dependencies. Then the rest of the method is shortly described and we outline the interest of the research in improving urban resilience. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We describe a large-scale simulation of a hypothetical nuclear detonation in an urban region. Simulating such a complex scenario requires modeling the population and its interactions with interdependent infrastructures such as transportation, communications, and healthcare. Our work represents the first model of a behaving human population, resolved to the individual level, where agents make decisions based on their health state, environmental conditions, and (informational) awareness. This 'big simulation' approach requires a large amount of carefully curated data at the input, which is combined into a 'synthetic information' model. The simulation is database-driven in a novel architecture that enables scaling, and it produces large amounts of data that in turn require advanced analytics in order to extract policy-relevant conclusions. We present results from a spatio-temporal analysis that draw out the connections between spatial variations in population behaviors and health outcomes. © 2013 IEEE.

These circumstances oblige to manage flood risk by integrating new concepts like urban resilience. The main aim of this paper is to illustrate that networks resilience represent an important issue for urban resilience analysis. Then, two main methods designed for assessing networks resilience are presented: methodology for modeling networks interdependencies and indicators for assessing redundancy. Finally, a Web GIS, implementing these two main methods, is presented. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Conventional urban water servicing has successfully provided cities with clean water, sanitation and flood protection. Traditional approaches are unsuited to address future challenges like climate change and modern urban development trends (e. g. migration, aging population, densification). As well as increased risks of water scarcity and flooding, society's demands for urban amenity and healthy waterways in metropolitan areas also challenge these traditional principles of urban water management. It is increasingly recognized that solutions to these challenges will not be purely technological in nature; the socio-institutional contexts will also be critical. However modelling tools to support medium and long-term strategic planning of integrated social and infrastructural dimensions are lacking, leaving decision-makers with untested policy ideas. To identify possible transition strategies to a resilient city, the development of the DAnCE4Water (Dynamic Adaptation for eNabling City Evolution for Water) within the EU FP7 project "PREPARED: Enabling Change" as a strategic planning and decision-support tool is thus proposed. DAnCE4Water allows 'What-if' experiments by investigating possible consequences of policies and strategic actions, taking into consideration urban development, climate change, biophysical environment and societal dynamics. This paper presents the concept of the DAnCE4Water tool and its application to an example city's evolution 20 years into the future. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

However, in the late 1900s, with the introduction of drainage pumps, outfall canals and equipment stations, New Orleans envisioned a city no longer constrained by either geography or tradition. Below-sea-level areas were drained and became footprints for new neighborhoods. After 1965's Hurricane Betsy, the Corps of Engineers undertook a series of construction projects throughout the New Orleans region to protect from future hurricanes. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina proved the city's storm protection system unfit to handle natural disasters, when eighty percent of New Orleans flooded. Consequently, government leaders, citizens, professionals and academic advisors have worked to achieve enhanced urban resiliency through recovery projects. New Orleans has embarked on its post-disaster journey by rethinking and reimagining the city and its neighborhoods for the betterment of all its citizens in an era of strengthening hurricanes, rising sea levels and climate change. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We explore the potential of urban ecosystem services for improving resilience and quality of life in cities. First, we classify and categorize important ecosystem services and disservices in urban areas. Second, we describe a range of valuation approaches (cultural values, health benefi ts, economic costs, and resilience) for capturing the importance of urban ecosystem service multiple values. Finally, we analyze how ecosystem service assessment may inform urban planning and governance and provide practical examples from cities in Africa, Europe, and America. From our review, we fi nd that many urban ecosystem services have already been identifi ed, characterized and valued, and have been found to be of great value and importance for human well-being and urban resilience. We conclude that the use of the concept of urban ecosystem services can play a critical role in reconnecting cities to the biosphere, and reducing the ecological footprint and ecological debt of cities while enhancing resilience, health, and quality of life of their inhabitants. © 2013, Springer Netherlands.

AB  - Immigrants represent a rapidly growing segment of the Canadian population: 48 percent of the population in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) and 40 percent in the Vancouver CMA are immigrants, the highest foreign-born metropolitan populations in the world. Immigrants' settlement in postindustrial cities with competitive housing and labour markets has been explored with spatial, economic, and social theories, particularly in disciplines such as geography and urban planning. However, there is a great potential for community resilience theories from the disciplines of ecology and psychology to provide a richer understanding of the choices of specific ethnocultural groups. This article introduces the literature on immigrants' housing and neighbourhood choices in Canadian cities, citing theories of spatial assimilation, housing career and structural change. These theories have contributed to researchers' understanding of how immigrants' patterns differ from those of non-immigrants. However, theories of community resilience provide a lens through which to view differences within the immigrant population. Using the definitions of simple resilience and psychological resilience, this article aims to view immigrants' housing choices through a new lens, and gives a different perspective to ethnocultural differences in housing patterns.© Licence Creative Commons.

AB  - Worldwide city authorities are facing problems in terms of rapid urbanization but also in terms of city resilience against natural disasters and the effects of climate change. The UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction program is asking cities %How resilient is your city'. The ITA Committee on Underground Space (ITACUS) is working together with UNISDR to demonstrate how the use of underground space can contribute to making cities more resilient. The use of underground space is underrated worldwide, yet it can prove to be invaluable to city governments as a strategic planning asset. This paper explores the issues and shows how underground space is already contributing. The main focus will be on those aspects that help cities cope with rapid urbanization and their efforts to become more resilient. Areas which will be explored include buildings, transport, energy supply, water and waste. The question will also be raised whether the use of underground space can take place as an autonomous activity or whether planning the use of underground space is required. In the opinion of the author the latter is the case. City governments require awareness of both the advantages of underground space use but also of the need to plan using this asset in a sustainable way. Only in that way will the use of underground space be to the advantage of cities. Copyright © 2013 by The Society for Rock Mechanics & Engineering Geology.

AB  - The core issues of this chapter are institutions, climate smart disaster risk management, adaptive capacity, and the institutional adaptation capacity. Our main focus is to review policies and strategies and institutional settings in order to identify institutional challenges to mainstream climate smart disaster risk reduction strategies in cities of Bangladesh. Therefore, the key contributions of this chapter are that we (a) identify possible entry points for mainstreaming climate smart risk management strategies, and (b) recognise some broad institutional constraints to address effectively climate change risks. Cities are at risk of the impacts of climate change on infrastructure, human lives, human health, and environmental quality. These effects will deepen in coming decades. Climate smart disaster risk management (CSDRM) approach can be considered as a holistic approach, because it provides guidelines to build adaptive capacities of local people and also local institutions. This chapter deals with some important core concepts such as institution, climate smart disaster risk management, adaptation capacity, and the institutional adaptation capacity. This chapter focuses particularly on the institutional challenges to mainstream climate smart strategies in cities of Bangladesh. For this, the chapter reviews policies, institutional settings, and legal frameworks underway in Bangladesh that respond to climate change, and discusses what currently constrains this. The review reveals that national as well as local level institutions in Bangladesh are already grappling with large deficits which limit capacity of these institutions to mainstream climate smart risk reduction strategies. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The increasing global rate of urbanisation and concurrent global climate changes create new challenges and new opportunities for managing cities, water resources and related quality of life. In most strategies, however, water ecosystems, which are the fundamental component of the integrated urban water resources management (IUWRM), are regarded as objects of protection or rehabilitation; not, as postulated by ecohydrology, as management tools. This paper addresses the possibilities of: (i) the functional incorporation of aquatic ecosystems into the IUWRM; (ii) optimising their functioning by local ecohydrological approach; and (iii) integration of ecosystem functions on a city scale to build system solutions for more resilient cities. Two case studies of the UNESCO MAB/IHP demonstration network representing different urban development patterns are given. The City of Łódź (Poland) uses water-resource based urban retrofitting for improving the quality of life and attracting inhabitants, departing from the analysis of longitudinal dynamics of nutrient transition in the river-reservoirs system, towards proposing an alternative concept of spatial city development. The city of Lyon (France), with intensive periurban development and population growth, provides a hierarchy of stream reaches to cope with combined sewer overflows to help municipalities to better position future urban runoff outlets. This article envisions also the future management of urban waste and storm waters using urban rivers, assuming resilient cities will depend on the integrity of environmental, technical and spatial planning decisions. The virtues of ecohydrology are discussed in this respect. © 2013 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of Polish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.

AB  - One of the tasks of urban and hazard planning is to mitigate the damages and minimize the costs of the recovery process after catastrophic events. The rapidity and the efficiency of the recovery process are referred to as resilience. A mathematical definition of resilience of an urban community has not yet been identified.We propose and test a methodology for the assessment of urban resilience to a catastrophic event. The idea is to merge the concepts of engineering resilience and ecosystem resilience. As first step we model a urban community by means of different hybrid complex networks, composed by human elements, i.e. the citizens, and physical elements, i.e. urban lifelines and infrastructures. As second step, we define a class of efficiency indexes on these hybrid networks. Then, we quantify the resilience of a urban system by computing these efficiency indexes before a simulated catastrophic event, after the event has occurred and during the subsequent recovery process. As a case study, we test this idea in case of simulated earthquakes in the city of Acerra, Italy. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - This paper stems from longlasting research dedicated to urban risk reduction through a planning approach. It focuses on public space, proposing an inversion of the usual perspective: Instead of considering public spaces for risk mitigation and urban redevelopment, here the imperatives of environmental safety and urban resilience can be instrumental for exploring the meaning and role of the public space from a different, rather compelling point of view. Instrumental for exploring the meaning and role of the public space from a different, rather compelling point of view. One starting point is the concept of SUM, Strategic Urban Structure (or Framework), from the Italian "Struttura urbana minima", which has been introduced in order to set out the contents of urban risk reduction in local administration agendas and particularly into ordinary planning processes. The SUM has been conceived both as an analytical and a normative/planning tool. Public spaces are the backbone of both urban structure and of the SUM. From their features, localization, distribution within the settlement, and their systemic characters, largely depend the capacity of a town to positively react to a seismic event. Six casestudies of small and mediumsize historic towns in the Umbria Region (one of the many Italian Regions with a high level of seismic risk), help to understand the complexities and problems related to seismic prevention within historical centres, and the conflicts between conservation of the heritage and the imperatives of environmental safety. In order to overcome possible criticalities identified in a SUM, it is necessary to provide alternatives to its functioning through redundant elements. The concept of redundancy, which is strictly related to that of uncertainty, is very interesting and promising in this field of research.

AB  - This article discusses the methodology adapted in designing city resilience concepts under changing climate scenarios for two cities in India, namely, Indore and Surat. This initiative was undertaken in the second phase (2009-2010) of Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) programme (www.acccrn.org). The process of resilience planning has demonstrated how local organizations have used new climate and urbanization information to identify vulnerabilities and capacities to develop integrated resilience plans. Local engagement in the development of the City Resilience Strategies resulted in a much greater understanding of the climate change issues and resilience processes among local and national partners. The strategy provides an overarching framework informed by visioning exercise, hazard risk assessment, vulnerability analysis, sector studies and pilot projects to demonstrate effectiveness of resilience options. Risk assessment was conducted to get a better understanding of impacts on city. City wide vulnerability assessment was carried out using object oriented analysis techniques to capture current vulnerability of different sections of population across space and socio-economic categories. The issue of climate change is cross-cutting, therefore, sector studies were undertaken to determine the degree to which existing systems can response to varying climatic conditions. The assessment results were integrated to draw an informed resilience approach for the cities in dealing with climate variability and change. Resilience strategy development was informed by climate science, hazard risk information, urban planning/development framework, current vulnerability and anticipated future risks. The resilience strategy is grounded on was resource constraints, economic development and critical uncertainties. Engagement with different institutions was carried out through extensive studies and consolidation from series of risk to resilience (R2R) workshops. This led to the empowerment and ownership by city stakeholders for the resilience strategy. This study is one of the pioneering efforts towards developing urban resilience strategies under changing climate scenarios for Indian cities. The methodology adapted for the two cities are currently being owned and replicated by other cities in India.

VL  - 4
IS  - NA
PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the role and challenges for Sri Lankan local governments in creating a disaster resilient built environment within urban Sri Lankan cities. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a literature review and a case study conducted in the Batticaloa city of Sri Lanka, supported by expert interviews among local and other government officials, policy makers, practitioners and academics who are engaged in disaster management and urban planning within the country. Findings: The literature and empirical data reveal that local governments are facing a number of challenges in contributing to making cities resilient to disasters. Some of the issues that have emerged are inadequate financial and human resource capabilities; a lack of knowledge of disaster risks and vulnerabilities; the need for long-term political commitment; a lack of focus on pre-disaster planning; inadequate legislative authority; a lack of clear cut responsibilities and coordination among agencies; and a lack of involvement in major development activities, physical planning and regulation of land use. It is important to address these challenges faced by local governments in creating a disaster resilient built environment in a holistic manner to ensure effective disaster risk reduction within cities. Research limitations/implications: The paper is based on partial findings of research which aims to explore and propose mechanisms to empower the Sri Lankan local governments to make cities more resilient to disasters, within the context of the built environment. Originality/value: The paper identifies the weaknesses of the current institutional arrangements in place for creating a disaster resilient built environment in Sri Lanka and highlights the challenges faced by a local government in creating a disaster resilient built environment within a Sri Lankan city. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Looking at the programme and the range of conferences in spatial planning around Europe in recent years, resilience seems to be the new buzzword in urban-regional matters. As such it is following sustainability, sometimes even used interchangeably. It is argued that, with a sound theoretical framework for an urban regional context still pending, it is difficult to apply resilience as a new paradigm to planning practice. Based on conceptual thoughts on resilience particularly in relation to the concept of sustainability, this contribution suggests that one challenge for urban regional resilience is the need for intensified collaboration between different disciplines as well as between science and practice. It concludes with suggestions on how to approach this challenge using existing platforms such as conferences or collaborative projects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Summary: Using the city of Toronto as a case study, this article examines impacts of energy stocks and flexible demand in the urban metabolism on the resilience of the city, including discussion of directions for further study of the resiliency of the urban metabolism. An important element developed is the nominal residence time of the energy stocks. This value defines how long an energy stock lasts under typical patterns of energy use. The findings suggest that the residence times of many sources of energy overcome vulnerability when energy supply shocks last on the order of hours or a few days, but that the measure is limited to assessing only certain types of commonly used energy sources in aggregate terms. Discussion is included on the uncertainty of this measure and on the metabolic and resiliency implications of new technologies intended to reduce energy use and improve sustainability of cities and the use of the urban metabolism as a means of comparison. The methodology employed highlights how waste energy could be used to increase the resiliency of the city's water supply, but also how the study of the urban metabolism would benefit from a more disaggregate form in the study of sustainable and resilient cities. © 2013 by Yale University.

The paper provides an overview of the pertinent concepts as well as the various approaches to the assessment of the resilience of cities. It elaborates on the concepts of complexity and dynamic systems and attempts to clarify the concept of resilience itself by analysing its characteristics and contrasting it with related concepts such as sustainability, resistance, equilibrium, stability, durability and robustness. It proposes that the essence of resilience is the ability of a system to absorb changes without a transition to a different state. © 2012 WIT Press.

AB  - Urban agriculture has been an indisputable part of cities during history. It is an important subject to improve sustainability of cities, urban landscapes, and agrarian society. Establishing the urban-rural linkages is a critical endeavor for the quality of life in urban areas. The present work elaborates the historical evolution of urban agriculture in the world. The review of different urban agriculture cases through literature and internet searches highlighted the effects of different eras on urban agriculture. The final outcome is presented in the form of a chronological diagram of urban agriculture. The findings show that through the history agriculture has played a big role in development of cities. It was the war, crises, and famine that contributed agriculture to rise in urban areas as a vital solution. The shortages and scarcity that came after the wars, created the 'back to the land' vision. Subsequently, the awareness influenced the lifestyle in every dimension, from political to architecture, and to landscape. Food, as one of the primary material of humans' lifecycle, was eventually recognized by communities and governments due to the emerging concept of sustainability.

AD  - NA
AB  - Cities, as complex systems, present different urban patterns and spatial dynamics with diverse and multiple characteristics. Urban systems change and reorganise according to the diverse outcomes of economic globalisation, based primarily on population data, but with secondary reference to trends in economic growth and restructuring, and to the various roles played by governments in shaping the urbanisation process (Bourne 1995). Thus, economic growth and restructuring resulting from globalisation creates certain population dynamics and mobility patterns that influence the reorganisation of urban spaces (drivers of the economic globalisation are discussed in detail in Chap. 5 for the case study areas introduced in this book). The reorganisation of urban space, which is strongly influenced by the adaptation strategies of cities to global processes and endogenous capacities, takes various forms. This chapter intends to explore these spatial forms and dynamics and their implications on the resilience of cities. It is argued in Chap. 1 that certain spatial patterns may provide capacity to the system to absorb disturbances and reorganise itself. In this chapter, in order to understand the extent of the spatial dynamics to address social and spatial challenges, both the inner city and peri-urbanised areas, first of all, these spatial dynamics are identified, and secondly, their relation to the attributes of resilience is clarified. In this respect this chapter aims to provide an umbrella conceptual framework for the relationship between spatial change and resilience. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

By means of a case study in an urban context, the role of place and social capital is analyzed during the emergency period following the earthquake occurred on 27 February 2010 in Chile. Results indicate that both factors strongly modified the inherent resilience of the city and the community. At first, citizens' capacity to absorb shocks generated b the event was surpassed, forcing people to adapt quickly to the new situation, drawing on the resources available in the area. the emergence of groups and unheard of behavior, as well as site characteristics, contributed positively to improve the adaptive resilience of the community. these factors should be considered in planning and/or reconstruction of more resilient cities. © EURE.

This paper proposes a comprehensive strategy of urban hazard mitigation aimed at the creation of resilient cities, able to withstand both types of threats. The paper reviews hazard mitigation practice, defines a resilient city, considers the relationship between resilience and terrorism, and discusses why resilience is important and how to apply its principles to physical and social elements of cities. Contending that current hazard mitigation policy, practice, and knowledge fail to deal with the unique aspects of cities under stress, the paper recommends a major resilient cities initiative, including expanded urban systems research, education and training, and increased collaboration among professional groups involved in city building and hazard mitigation.

AB  - Local Code uses geospatial analysis to identify thousands of publicly owned abandoned sites in major US cities, imagining this distributed, vacant landscape as a new urban system. Deploying GIS analysis in conjunction with parametric design software, a landscape proposal for each site is tailored to local conditions, optimizing thermal and hydrological performance to enhance local performance and enhance the whole city's ecology. Relieving burdens on existing infrastructure, such a digitally mediated, dispersed system provides important opportunities for urban resilience and transformation. In a case study of San Francisco, the projects' quantifiable effects on energy usage and stormwater remediation would eradicate 88-96% of the need for more expensive, centralized, sewer, and electrical upgrades. As a final, essential layer, the project proposes digital citizen participation to conceive a new, more public infrastructure as well.

AB  - By 2050 two-thirds of the world's population will live in urban areas (UN Habitat, 2006). As a result the dramatic urbanisation process is depleting the world's resources and the chief culprit behind climate change. Resilient cities can adapt to changes, grand challenges and can balance ecosystem and human functions. Spatial planning aims at making cities more resilient and sustainable which requires innovation, foresight, effective partnership and networks among all actors involved in urban planning processes. In practice, the implementation of these ideas is difficult because cities are dynamic structures and spatial planning processes as well as their outputs are very diverse across Europe and the world. Harmonised spatial planning information and spatial data infrastructures (SDI) encourage monitoring and more transparent planning processes. SDI can be a supportive element for spatial planning processes as it provides important harmonised data input and helps to better understand the complexity of cities and planning. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The socio economic context of the Province of Siena (central Italy) is peculiar because it is characterised by the same development trend of western countries but, at the same time, it is not completely affected by the negative aspects of this. The SPIn-Eco project is a triennial research program with the purpose of assessing the environmental conditions of the Province of Siena (Tuscany, central Italy) and its 36 municipalities. It is a deep analysis of the state of the territorial system by a complete set of instruments and indicators. This paper shows the aggregated results of the analysis for the northern area of the Province of Siena, called Val d'Elsa, which is composed by 6 municipalities. The area is characterised by variegated geomorphology, environmental aspects and urbanization. At the same time, each municipality is traditionally inclined to the development of some activities: agriculture, industry, craft, tourism respectively. The paper presents an environmental assessment of the use of resources at a local level by using some methodologies and sustainability indicators: emergy evaluation (introduced by Howard Odum), greenhouse gas inventory (according to the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories) and ecological footprint analysis (introduced by M. Wackernagel and W. Rees). The discussion section deals with the environmental, social and economic aspects of these under a sustainable perspective. We believe that the distribution of different peculiarities on the territory could be emphasized as a sort of "anthropic (or urban) resilience" of the system by a correct territorial planning activity towards sustainability.

AB  - Resilience appears to have become a buzz word since the ecological, psychological, social and economic sciences began to use it to refer, respectively, to the capacity of ecosystems, people, societies, the economy, and more recently even urban systems to cope with disturbance. In fact, it is unclear exactly what the catchword «resilient city» means. Based on these assumptions, this article reviews resilience perspectives and their possible application to urban systems. In the first part of the paper, the concept of resilience, its evolution and perspectives (from engineering to social ecology) are analyzed with reference to ecosystems, societies and complex systems. In the second part we try to shed light on this panacea of concepts applied to cities. Important insights of this review are that certain resilience engineering perspectives (such as recovery and persistence views) can lead to unsustainable patterns of development in cities, while from complex systems resilience perspectives the principles of sustainability and transformability emerge as the consequent and necessary trajectory. While the term «resilient cities» often refers only to the capacity to maintain functions and structures, we argue that urban resilience should be framed within the resilience (system persistence), transition (system incremental change) and transformation (system reconfiguration) views.

AB  - Drawing on Simmel's view of the modern metropolis, the article provides a reflection on the present research on megacities and likewise a corrective to approaches focusing too unilaterally on risks. At the same time the emergence and advancement of megacities will be explored in the context of the current processes of urbanization, globalization, and metropolization. It will be argued that a "hazards perspective" on major cities needs to be complemented by a focus on the potential of these cities, i.e., on hope, creativity, and urban resilience. Overall, it is concluded that city size is not necessarily an obstacle to sustainability. © 2011 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Urban resilience assumes the persistence of the city. However, this notion that cities should persist or be resilient was by no means taken for granted in earlier times. The fact that cities could fall, could vanish entirely or be moved to be rebuilt elsewhere was an accepted notion in many parts of the pre-modern world. Partly this derives from a world-view more intimately aware of the mortality and vulnerability of the human body. Many early religions emphasized the fleeting nature of life and the existence of suffering (whatever its cause) and the possibility of any kind of reconciliation with this world only possible through some form of acceptance, referred to in the Tao-Te-Ching of ancient China as wu wei (lit. no action) (Lao Tzu, 1963). The prevalence of the acceptance of change can be seen not just in Taoism but also in Indian Hinduism and Buddhism and in the pre-Socratic philosophers in ancient Greece, particularly Heraclitus. If change is regarded as the fundamental nature of the world, then attempts to ‘fix’ anything can only be temporary. © 2009, Jon Coaffee, David Murakami Wood and Peter Rogers.

VL  - 100

PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - The extent to which the 21st century world will be " sustainable" depends in large part on the sustainability of cities. Early ideas on implementing sustainability focused on concepts of achieving stability, practicing effective management and the control of change and growth - a " fail-safe" mentality. More recent thinking about change, disturbance, uncertainty, and adaptability is fundamental to the emerging science of resilience, the capacity of systems to reorganize and recover from change and disturbance without changing to other states - in other words, systems that are " safe to fail." While the concept of resilience is intellectually intriguing, it remains largely unpracticed in contemporary urban planning and design. This essay discusses the theory of resilience as it applies to urban conditions, and offers a suite of strategies intended to build urban resilience capacity: multifunctionality, redundancy and modularization, (bio and social) diversity, multi-scale networks and connectivity, and adaptive planning and design. The strategies are discussed in the context of resilience theory and sustainability science, and are illustrated with innovative policies, projects, and programs selected from international examples. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years resilience has emerged as a key concept in public policy. After September 11 in particular, resilience has become an increasingly central organizing metaphor within the policy-making process and in the expanding institutional framework of national security and disaster preparedness and mitigation. As it has evolved, resilience has begun to infiltrate a host of additional, more loosely connected, social and economic policies. This growth in importance has been underpinned by the political prioritization of the safety and security of communities against an array of perceived hazards and threats, including terrorism, disease pandemic and global warming-related flooding. These priorities have been focused on cities because of the particular vulnerability of densely populated political, economic and cultural centres. © 2009, Jon Coaffee, David Murakami Wood and Peter Rogers.

AB  - The new century has brought the new perspective that goals for natural hazard reduction need to shift from safety to resilience. What constitutes life safety began with the goal that occupants have a reasonable chance of being safe inside a building during the earthquake and are able to exit on their own afterwards. Resilience requires a complete set of transparent performance goals that declare what is needed from both the lifeline systems and the buildings to facilitate recovery. The federal government should take the lead in establishing goals needed for recovery along with incentives to adopt and implement them. The federal government needs to set performance standards that can be embedded in the design codes, provide financial incentives to stimulate mitigation that benefits the nation, and continue to support research that delivers new technologies that minimize the cost of mitigation, response and recovery. The City and County of San Francisco has launched a comprehensive recovery planning initiative comprised of 75 different projects aimed at improving the City's ability to recover. The overarching benefit of the shift from safety to resilience is the ability of communities to take the hit of a natural disaster in stride and recover to a new though recognizable normal without loss of life, their economies, jobs, or cultural heritage.

PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - This article discusses the post-disaster urban resilience design framework in the case of post-disaster urban reconstruction in Sichuan after the Great Sichuan Earthquake (also known as the Wenchuan Earthquake) in May 2008 in China. The focus is on three main aspects of post-disaster urban reconstruction: sociospatial coherence, temporal continuity, and multistakeholder integration and communication. Critical interpretation of the government-guided reconstruction reveals that reconstruction was limited to the generic production and implementation of top-down planning. From the perspective of urban resilience, and through an alternative design scenario developed in this research, this article highlights an urban resilience design framework based on post-disaster development in the Sichuan city of Dujiangyan. By identifying the deficiencies of the governmental reconstruction where in many aspects resilience has not been considered, and by proposing the alternative where resilience has been considered to develop a better living, this research seeks to integrate urban resilience as a key aspect in the Sichuan reconstruction and as essential for developing the post-disaster city towards a more coherent, sustainable, and integral urban future. © 2012, The Author(s).

This paper firstly aims at investigating this issue through the prism of scale-hierarchic distributions: fractals, power laws, Zipf's laws and Pareto distributions. Authors notably emphasize the mathematical proximity between these distributions. Building on the convergence of Prigogine's dissipative structure theory, industrial ecology and Bejan's constructal law, authors then stress the crucial role that power law distributed complex urban structures have to play to make cities energy efficient and resilient. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Phoenix metropolitan agglomeration (Fig. 7.1) is one of the fastest-growing conurbations in the United States, and is the focus of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research Project (CAP LTER) (Grimm et al. 2000, Grimm and Redman 2004). This project has been the locus of significant remote sensing investigation and characterization of the Phoenix urban and peri-urban areas (Stefanov 2002), combined with ground truthing and allied studies (Hope et al. 2003). The information derived from these and other studies is increasingly being used by local governments and regional planners (GP2100 2003). As an example, the City of Scottsdale, Arizona has used high-resolution, airborne, multispectral data to assess impervious and pervious land-cover percentages for surface water runoff studies. This use of remotely sensed information, rather than traditional ground-based surveys, produced estimated cost savings of eight to fifteen million dollars for the city (W. Erickson 1999). Construction of an advanced visualization and modeling environment (a decision theater) that integrates remotely sensed and other geospatial data for the Phoenix metropolitan region was completed in 2005 at Arizona State University (J. Fink 2005). Use of such an advanced system enables near real-time modeling of the impact of planning and development decisions. Remotely sensed data acquired at a variety of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions provides the basic biophysical information necessary to initialize models of urban resilience and sustainability. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AD  - NA
AB  - Cities are facing considerable challenges resulting from imminent climate change impacts. Urban planning to minimise adverse impacts of climate change at the city level can establish a climate-resilient city. Mitigation strategies to reduce CO 2 emissions would lead to a climate-friendly city. Integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation into sustainable city planning should not be merely added as a single level of sustainable city planning, but requires a wide range of multi-level cooperation. Lijiang City has experienced climatic change during the last half century, and its CO 2 emissions have increased faster than the GDP growth. Nearby glaciers on Yulong Snow Mountain have been retreating and losing mass since the early twentieth century. In this paper, we identify economic sectors that are vulnerable to climate change, including tourism, agriculture and water supply, and propose mitigation and adaptation strategies to cope with climate change in this tourism city. As energy use is the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy has enormous CO 2 reduction potential. Land use practices, a sectoral approach and public participation are all considered adaptive in climate planning. The proposals outlined are valuable as they provide an understanding of how to implement integrated climate planning and integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation into sustainable city planning. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Examples are provided of trends and challenges impacting the resilience of South Africa's metropolitan regions, as identified in recent empirical studies conducted by the authors.1 The paper argues that the agglomeration challenges facing South Africa's metropolitan regions and complications brought about by intra-metropolitan inequality are key aspects underlying the resilience of these regions. The article also suggests that there might be value in greater collaboration in research and knowledge-production and sharing in metropolitan planning, development and governance, between South African metropolitan regions and those in Central European countries.

These were primarily developed in order to build up a consistent degree of resilience across the country in order to prepare for, and respond to, a variety of threats faced. Although this has been driven since the 1980s by a concern for Integrated Emergency Management (IEM), and despite the concerns of provincial cities over flooding and the threat of animal disease pandemics to rural areas, it is clear that the threat of terrorism has become the predominant driver at state level. This has enabled emergency planning to enjoy unprecedented funding and profile at all scales. In the last chapter, we explored what this might mean for the everyday life of the city from spatial governance to institutional and personal responsibilization. © 2009, Jon Coaffee, David Murakami Wood and Peter Rogers.

AB  - Resilient Cities: Responding to PeakOil and Climate Change authored by Peter Newman, Timothy Beatley and Heather Boyer provides a well-written discussion of the challenges that cities face, not only from the peak oil challenge, but also in the context of the impacts of climate change. The authors start by setting the scene regarding the challenges the metropolitan areas face in responding to their increasing carbon footprint, dependence on fossil fuels, and impact on the irreplaceable natural resources. The book proceeds by providing many illuminating but shocking figures about how far the increasingly urbanized residents of this planet have traveled down a wrong path. The case for resilient cities is structured upon seven key elements, including the renewable energy city, the carbon neutral city, the distributed city, the sustainable transport city, the photosynthetic city, the place-based city, and the eco-efficient city.

AB  - I would like to focus my brief remarks on Shannon Dawdy's very important third question, can archaeology save the world? But to show my biases up front, I would rephrase it to read, how can archaeologists usefully contribute to public policy considerations on the future of this planet?, or perhaps just modify her question to say, how can archaeologists help save the world? As one looks at recent books such as Newman, Beatley and Boyer's Resilient cities. Responding to peak oil and climate change (2009), Richard Heinberg's The party's over. Oil, war and the fate of industrial societies (2005), or Howard and Elisabeth Odum's A prosperous way down (2001) or key articles such as Ecology in times of scarcity by John Day et al. (2009) or Tracking the ecological overshoot of the human economy by Mathis Wackernagel et al. (2002), it seems clear to me that archaeologists could readily amplify the important arguments mounted by these authors and play a useful role in helping planners confront looming global cultural-ecological issues. It is not that these writers are unaware of archaeology and its potential contributions - Heinberg (2005, 34-38), for example, looks quite favorably on the work of Joseph Tainter - but that archaeological research could be more thoroughly and productively utilized.

AB  - The conceptual framework of flood management addresses the relationship among flood hazard, flood vulnerability and flood risk. Most of the active efforts in the Republic of Slovenia were focused towards flood hazard mapping. In this research, the issue of flood vulnerability and flood hazard is addressed in order to systematically reduce flood hazards. In this article, an advanced theoretical approach is presented, which defines flood vulnerability and (in connection to flood risk) provides information on flood hazards. Based upon this, it is possible to define flood hazards in monetary terms. This approach is setting forward special information that is missing from existing public registries, i.e. benchmark data. The article also presents a new concept of flood hazard definition, which is based upon different uses of flood hazard information: rescue and relief measures, optimization and selection of flood hazard mitigation measures, development of individual flood proofing measures, and other. All the listed measures have their spatial dimension, which is also a subject of positioning into space. In this framework, an information of spatial positioning of existing flood hazard and mitigation measures aiming at the reduction of flood hazard is challenged, especially from the point of view of development of documents that define development of specific area.

AB  - Along with the threat of climate change and its related hazards, rapid urban growth is leading to unplanned urbanization, high population density and environmental degradation of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Already the severity of climate-related hazards, especially flooding, is increasing. It is predicted that among the coastal mega-cities Dhaka would be the most vulnerable to climate change. This research measures the existing level of climate disaster resilience of Dhaka City Corporation by assessing the problems and potentialities in different sectors. The Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) was calculated for 10 different zones of Dhaka City Corporation. CDRI analysis comprises five different dimensions (physical, social, economic, institutional and natural), 25 parameters and 125 variables (development issues). Findings show that besides location, the utility services, accessibility to roads, housing and land-use, health, social capital and environmental conditions are each playing a role in determining the resilience level of different zones. It is interesting to note that the planned residential areas have relatively higher levels of climate disaster resilience, while old parts of the city and densely populated low income areas have lower levels of resilience. Dhaka, being the primate city of the country, continuously faces numerous challenges and opportunities. It is expected that by utilizing CDRI results in policy formulation and development planning, these challenges could be minimized and opportunities enhanced, leading to a more resilient city in the future. 2011 Policy Studies Organization.

The social and environmental concerns might provoke the collapse of this economic concern. The sustainability has to be the approach to conciliate these three pillars. In this paper, we present two major issues; the first one is related to the infrastructure management and resilience considerations and the second one concerns the implementation of high rise buildings in the context of Greater Paris. These two examples allow to present our approach to integrate innovation in built environment issues to consider the specific issues of sustainability in global cities.

AB  - Urbanization is a global multidimensional process paired with increasing uncertainty due to climate change, migration of people, and changes in the capacity to sustain ecosystem services. This article lays a foundation for discussing transitions in urban governance, which enable cities to navigate change, build capacity to withstand shocks, and use experimentation and innovation in face of uncertainty. Using the three concrete case cities New Orleans, Cape Town, and Phoenixthe article analyzes thresholds and cross-scale interactions, and expands the scale at which urban resilience has been discussed by integrating the idea from geography that cities form part of "system of cities" (i.e., they cannot be seen as single entities). Based on this, the article argues that urban governance need to harness social networks of urban innovation to sustain ecosystem services, while nurturing discourses that situate the city as part of regional ecosystems. The article broadens the discussion on urban resilience while challenging resilience theory when addressing human-dominated ecosystems. Practical examples of harnessing urban innovation are presented, paired with an agenda for research and policy. © 2010 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Climate change and energy insecurity are grave threats to the stability and sustainability of human society. This paper considers the meaning of this globally manifest, yet regionally differentiated, ecological threat for Australia's urban system. It also considers the twin ecological peril of oil depletion, whose impacts may intensify to great effect the social stresses likely to emerge as climates warm. The paper intervenes in the debate that transfixes contemporary Australian urbanism: the sustainability of the suburban form in which most Australians live. A similar if not identical debate exists in North America and parts of western Europe. These discussions may be overemphasising the environmental significance of urban form and failing to apprehend the deeper socio-cultural forces that drive the (over)consumption of nature. Planning thought and practice need to loosen the grip of physical determinism on their environmental comprehension if they are to comprehend accurately the sources of, and solutions to, ecological threat. New urban scientific evidence suggests that planning's principal role in the fight against warming will be one of adaptation not mitigation. That is to say, there is no simple 'spatial fix' for overconsumption. © 2008 Urban Studies Journal Limited.

AB  - River cities require a management approach based on resilience to floods rather than on resistance. Resisting floods by means of levees, dams, and channelization neglects inherent uncertainties arising from human-nature couplings and fails to address the extreme events that are expected to increase with climate change, and is thereby not a reliable approach to long-term flood safety. By applying resilience theory to address system persistence through changes, I develop a theory on "urban resilience to floods" as an alternative framework for urban flood hazard management. Urban resilience to floods is defined as a city's capacity to tolerate flooding and to reorganize should physical damage and socioeconomic disruption occur, so as to prevent deaths and injuries and maintain current socioeconomic identity. It derives from living with periodic floods as learning opportunities to prepare the city for extreme ones. The theory of urban resilience to floods challenges the conventional wisdom that cities cannot live without flood control, which in effect erodes resilience. To operationalize the theory for planning practice, a surrogate measure-the percent floodable area-is developed for assessing urban resilience to floods. To enable natural floodplain functions to build urban resilience to floods, flood adaptation is advocated in order to replace flood control for mitigating flood hazards. © 2012 by the author(s).

AB  - This paper presents a strategy for scaling climate change adaptation within urban areas. The strategy specifically focuses on the requirements for mobilizing large amounts of capital for adaptation and other urban risk reduction above and beyond the amounts that will likely be mobilized through new international adaptation funds. The paper, based on a report published by ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability,(1) proposes a re-framing of the urban adaptation and disaster reduction challenge. The approach shifts the adaptation focus from risk reduction as a primary end in itself to a broader development focus on financing the performance of urban assets, areas and/or systems. This emphasis is elaborated through the concept of "resilience", an urban design and investment metric that measures the ability of urban areas and their individual assets to perform for users and their investors under a wide range of conditions. The paper argues that such a performance-oriented approach provides a business logic that can attract conventional, private investment flows to climate and disaster risk reduction measures and thereby "mainstream" them. © 2012 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).

AB  - In view of all the damage caused by flooding that has affected large numbers of regions throughout the world over the last ten years, urban areas appear to be little prepared for facing up to this type of catastrophe. Today, improving their resilience, i.e. their capacity to recover rapidly after flooding, appears to be a real issue at stake in societies' sustainable development. Due to their organization in the form of subsystems , the multiple aspects of their functions and the dynamics that drive them, these urban territories must be considered as complex systems. Within these urban systems, technical networks are physical links between inhabitants and the actors involved, the symbolic links of belonging to the same community, to the same organized territory (Lacoste quoted by Dupuy, 1991). As supports and even objects of interactions between the different sub-systems in the urban system and with the outside environment, they supply, unify and irrigate all the constituent elements of urban territories. In this way, networks participate in organizing and regulating the system by being the vector of relations between its different constituent elements. "Physically connecting the elements in the system unifies them and creates the network's operating conditions at the same time. In the same way, it makes a certain mode of operation and evolutions in the system possible" (Dupuy, 1984). This strategic position makes networks extremely influent in the dynamics of maintaining the global urban system. In turn, they can be generators of incidents by interrupting flows or vectors in the propagation of unforeseen turns of events. Therefore, characterizing their resilience to flooding may prove to be interesting in for providing a better understanding of urban resilience. In this context, we have decided to work on the resilience of waste management networks. Because they raise essential questions on sanitation and public health and because they often have a strong visual and psychological impact, these networks appear to be real issues at stake in crisis management. After flooding, the volume of waste generated is often significant and of a different sort (mixed, even polluted wet waste). Faced with this situation, waste management poses a real problem. What should be done with this waste? How should it be collected? Where can it be stored? How should it be processed? Who is in charge? Providing answers to these questions is all the more strategic inasmuch as post&hyphen;flood waste is the visual sign of the catastrophe. As a result, cleaning up is populations' and local actors' first reflex in order to forget what has happened, but also in order to start up again as quickly as possible. Therefore, it would appear primordial to improve waste management networks' resilience to flooding (Beraud et al..., 2010). First and foremost, improving the resilience of an organization requires understanding the way it operates in order to identify what dysfunctions it may contain. A methodology needs to be developed for this purpose, capable of analyzing a waste management network's way of operation under normal and crisis conditions. In this way, risks and potential dangers resulting from the urban system being flooded can be identified and the means of prevention for improving the waste management network's resilience to flooding can be brought out. Choosing the right methodology is not an easy task. Numerous methods of risk analysis exist. For the most part they are of industrial origin. As a result, it is not always easy to use them for studying social systems such as urban technical networks, as these systems possess characteristics that differ considerably from industrial systems. "Multiple responsibilities with regard to the design, build, operation and maintenance of networks, separated amongst numerous actors who do not regularly communicate together and share information" are, for example, one of the particularities of risk control in an urban environment (Prost, in Blancher, 1998). As a result, the way in which networks operate may appear to be extremely complex: the diversity and involvement of actors, different scales and territories to be taken into account, the issues at stake concerning the public service mission, catastrophic consequences, that are immediate and those with important repercussions when they are interrupted, etc. This complexity makes it extremely difficult to model urban networks (Maiolini, 1992), whereas applying methods used in the world of industry requires that models are created beforehand. Therefore, there are real methodology stakes in play when transferring these methods from industrial engineering to urban engineering. This article will present the methodology set up followed by initial results. Copyright © ASCE 2011.

AB  - Many disasters may follow a predictable pattern of rescue, restoration, rebuilding, and remembrance. Nevertheless, a recovery can be truly evaluated based on the specific circumstances. Extracting common messages, let alone lessons from wide-ranging stories of urban resilience is challenging. Yet, several themes stand out which are as follows: narratives of resilience are a political necessity; local resilience is linked to national renewal; resilience benefits from the inertia of prior investment; resilience exploits the power of place; resilience casts opportunism as opportunity; and resilience, like disaster, is site-specific.

AB  - Resilience is the ability of a system to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic function and structure. Since 2005, more than half of the world population lives in cities. It's estimated that in 30 years time, this figure will most likely reach 80%[1]. Cities are the ecosystems were humans mostly live. In a world threatened by economic crisis, depletion of natural and ecological resources, diminishing biodiversity and climate change, sustainability depends on resilience. Resilience theories study complex social-economical systems, originally natural ones such as forests, coral reefs or lakes. After disasters like hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans, or the Haitian earthquake, certain awareness about urban resilience has been raised. Focus and research on the resilience of urban ecosystems is needed. Why is resilience thinking important? Would it provide the opportunity for a "new" urbanism? What is being done, what can be done? What role can architects play?.

AB  - Recent thinking amongst conservationists, urban planners, and those in the cultural field, has focused on differences in the views and beliefs about cultural heritage and urban regeneration. Examples include the approaches to and understanding of conservation in the Asian region that tend to rely on total reconstruction or restoration to preserve monuments in the urban environment. This is underpinned by the belief in the importance of intangible values as opposed to tangible, the spiritual aspects of a site or place and the relationship between landscape and monument within the cultural landscape. There have been attempts to address these differences. Conservation guidelines such as the Nara Document on Authenticity and charters such as the Burra Charter provide flexibility in interpretations of cultural significance. However, the debate remains fractured and the solutions provided remain firmly within the Western/Euro-centric mechanistic reductionist worldview. This paper proposes and alternative theoretical framework to understanding and interpreting the process of urban regeneration in the Asian region by adopting the principles of resilience thinking. Resilience thinking engages in a transdisciplinary way the dynamic interconnections and interdependencies amongst the key systems of the urban environment. In summary, the work in the field of resilience thinking has made great gains in providing an understanding of the complex nature of social-ecological systems and how these could be better prepared to deal with disturbances and in the long term be sustainable. From the studies on urban resilience there is potential for an exciting opportunity to rethink our understanding of cultural built heritage and urban regeneration as a social-ecological system developing a more universal approach to its regeneration and ultimately its sustainability.

AB  - On September the 4 th 2010 and February 22 nd 2011 the Canterbury region of New Zealand was shaken by two massive earthquakes. This paper is set broadly within the civil defence and emergency management literature and informed by recent work on community participation and social capital in the building of resilient cities. Work in this area indicates a need to recognise both the formal institutional response to the earthquakes as well as the substantive role communities play in their own recovery. The range of factors that facilitate or hinder community involvement also needs to be better understood. This paper interrogates the assumption that recovery agencies and officials are both willing and able to engage communities who are themselves willing and able to be engaged in accordance with recovery best practice. Case studies of three community groups - CanCERN, Greening the Rubble and Gap Filler - illustrate some of the difficulties associated with becoming a community during the disaster recovery phase. Based on my own observations and experiences, combined with data from approximately 50 in-depth interviews with Christchurch residents and representatives from community groups, the Christchurch City Council, the Earthquake Commission and so on, this paper outlines some practical strategies emerging communities may use in the early disaster recovery phase that then strengthens their ability to 'participate' in the recovery process. © The Author(s) 2011.

AB  - A metaphorical definition of resiliency is used in this paper: the capacity to weather and adapt to stress from hazards, and the ability to recover quickly from their impacts. Resiliency is often discussed in conjunction with vulnerability, a measure of the adverse effects of a hazardous event on a system, the magnitude of which is influenced by the system's resiliency. Vulnerability is determined by risk-proximity or exposure to hazards, which affects the probability of adverse impact and is a robustness-measure of the system's ability to adapt to a wide range of possible future conditions, at little additional cost. The greatest challenges for urban water infrastructure design, planning and management lie in our limited ability to quantify potential future conditions. This paper explores the utility of the fuzzy set theory in the field of water resource systems reliability analysis and proposes three new fuzzy reliability measures: (i) a combined reliability-vulnerability index, (ii) a robustness index, and (iii) a resiliency index.

TI  - Tsunami height poles and disaster awareness: Memory, education and awareness of disaster on the reconstruction for resilient city in Banda Aceh, Indonesia
JO  - NA
PY  - 2010
VL  - 19
IS  - NA
PB  - NA
AD  - NA
AB  - Purpose – This paper seeks to demonstrate a unique project with tsunami height poles and disaster education to maintain disaster awareness for several decades in the area where the Indian Ocean tsunami caused significant damage in 2004. Design/methodology/approach – A case study approach is utilized combined with field observation, participatory observation and a general literature review of relevant studies and secondary sources. Findings – The major finding is that the unique device of 85 tsunami height poles was brought from the outside to Banda Aceh city so that people may remember the impact of the tsunami over a longer period of time when awareness is likely to reduce. As local people gradually understood the significance of the poles, the number of local cooperators increased and the project's impact improved significantly. Research limitations/implications – The longterm impact of the disaster resilience is yet to be verified in Banda Aceh city. The field research results of the project's process and impact immediately connected with grassroots practice with people to maintain disaster awareness and resilence for the city. The practice to which the Hyogo Framework for Action gives priority connects with building understanding of tsunami risk and disaster awareness with local knowledge, assimilated by preserving disaster records and visualizing disaster. Practical implications – The paper describes a fieldbased project in Banda Aceh city and the suburb, Indonesia, which was implemented in cooperation with local communities, local nongovernment organizations, local school boards and specialists from Kyoto University, Japan. Thus, the study findings are directly related to its practical implications. Originality/value – The paper highlights how the device of 85 tsunami height poles which were built in order to visualize disaster and maintain disaster awareness under the concept, blended an expert's unique idea with old Japanese knowledge in Banda Aceh city by the local community in Indonesia in June 2007. The paper shows that local ideas maintain living knowledge and lessons with sustainable development in the local place after the project had finished and recommendations can apply to the other tsunami affected areas. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Nowadays, the most common approach to seismic risk mitigation is characterized only by strategies reducing building vulnerability, through structural interventions, and it does not consider the possibility to intervene at urban scale, reducing urban seismic vulnerability. This paper deals with the concept of urban seismic vulnerability, and introduces resilience, as the capacity of a system to adapt itself to new, generally negative, conditions, in order to re-establish normal conditions. Each city can express resilience, and the identification of its elements is the goal of our research. A spatial multi-criteria approach is here proposed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - To date, little social science understanding has been developed about what it would mean to strategically build resilience in the context of such rich interdependencies between social, technical and natural worlds. We argue that shifts in strategies to deal with urban crises marks a turn from the politics of urgency, characteristic of crisis management, towards a governance of preparedness, characterised by strategies to build urban resilience. Social science needs to develop research agendas that critically engage with different understandings of resilience and the challenges of building resilience across different scales of urban governance. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.
