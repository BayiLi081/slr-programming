J	Chelleri, L				Chelleri, Lorenzo			From the "Resilient City" to Urban Resilience. A review essay on understanding and integrating the resilience perspective for urban systems	DOCUMENTS D ANALISI GEOGRAFICA			English	Review						Resilient cities; urban resilience; adaptation to climate change; transition towns; sustainability	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; LAND-USE; ADAPTABILITY; BIODIVERSITY; LANDSCAPES; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; COMPLEXITY; EVOLUTION; SHIFTS	Resilience appears to have become a buzz word since the ecological, psychological, social and economic sciences began to use it to refer, respectively, to the capacity of ecosystems, people, societies, the economy, and more recently even urban systems to cope with disturbance. In fact, it is unclear exactly what the catchword "resilient city" means. Based on these assumptions, this article reviews resilience perspectives and their possible application to urban systems. In the first part of the paper, the concept of resilience, its evolution and perspectives (from engineering to social ecology) are analyzed with reference to ecosystems, societies and complex systems. In the second part we try to shed light on this panacea of concepts applied to cities. Important insights of this review are that certain resilience engineering perspectives (such as recovery and persistence views) can lead to unsustainable patterns of development in cities, while from complex systems resilience perspectives the principles of sustainability and transformability emerge as the consequent and necessary trajectory. While the term "resilient cities" often refers only to the capacity to maintain functions and structures, we argue that urban resilience should be framed within the resilience (system persistence), transition (system incremental change) and transformation (system reconfiguration) views.

This has resulted in an urgent need for a radical and large-scale eco-technological overhaul. This chapter focuses on the paradigm shift towards sustainability and resilience, and particularly, how the new thinking of resilience can convert investments in urban infrastructure and development into resilient support systems, enabling both greater city prosperity and environmental regeneration. The objectives of this chapter are to search for new paths in the creation of resilient communities through the sustainable use of technologies; to discuss the significance of equity, economy, and traditional knowledge in resilient cities; to put forward a green approach that encompasses both mitigation and adaptation; and to explore potential and practical ways of creating urban resilience. A detailed review of existing definitions and policies related to urban resilience, as well as the role of eco-technologies and city planners in this process, is also presented. The chapter concludes by suggesting a set of urban design strategies and a list of key stakeholders as critical ingredients in the move towards urban resilience.

Resisting floods by means of levees, dams, and channelization neglects inherent uncertainties arising from human-nature couplings and fails to address the extreme events that are expected to increase with climate change, and is thereby not a reliable approach to long-term flood safety. By applying resilience theory to address system persistence through changes, I develop a theory on "urban resilience to floods" as an alternative framework for urban flood hazard management. Urban resilience to floods is defined as a city's capacity to tolerate flooding and to reorganize should physical damage and socioeconomic disruption occur, so as to prevent deaths and injuries and maintain current socioeconomic identity. It derives from living with periodic floods as learning opportunities to prepare the city for extreme ones. The theory of urban resilience to floods challenges the conventional wisdom that cities cannot live without flood control, which in effect erodes resilience. To operationalize the theory for planning practice, a surrogate measure-the percent floodable area-is developed for assessing urban resilience to floods. To enable natural floodplain functions to build urban resilience to floods, flood adaptation is advocated in order to replace flood control for mitigating flood hazards.

Analyzing resilience of urban networks: a preliminary step towards more flood resilient cities	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article								In Europe, river floods have been increasing in frequency and severity. These circumstances require the management of flood risk by integrating new concepts like urban resilience. Nevertheless, urban resilience seems to have no accurate meanings. That is why researchers are primarily concerned with defining resilience. Nevertheless, focus on research object seems to be more important than focus on conceptual debate ( Resilience of what? Rather than what is resilience?). Thus the methodology designed here is focused on urban considerations. In fact, a system approach emphasizes technical networks' importance concerning urban resilience. Principles and assumptions applied in this research finally lead to the analysis of how urban networks are able to face natural hazards. In this context, a Web-GIS has been developed for analyzing resistance capacity, absorption capacity and recovery capacity of different technical networks. A first application has been carried out on a French agglomeration in order to analyze road network absorption capacity. This application is very specific but, thanks to this example, it is already possible to highlight the methodology's usefulness.

This paper firstly aims at investigating this issue through the prism of scale-hierarchic distributions: fractals, power laws, Zipf's laws and Pareto distributions. Authors notably emphasize the mathematical proximity between these distributions. Building on the convergence of Prigogine's dissipative structure theory, industrial ecology and Bejan's constructal law, authors then stress the crucial role that power law distributed complex urban structures have to play to make cities energy efficient and resilient.

Analysing urban resilience through alternative stormwater management options: application of the conceptual Spatial Decision Support System model at the neighbourhood scale	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						DS3 model; neighbourhood scale; stormwater management system; urban resilience		Recent changes in cities and their environments, caused by rapid urbanisation and climate change, have increased both flood probability and the severity of flooding. Consequently, there is a need for all cities to adapt to climate and socio-economic changes by developing new strategies for flood risk management. Following a risk paradigm shift from traditional to more integrated approaches, and considering the uncertainties of future urban development, one of the main emerging tasks for city managers becomes the development of resilient cities. However, the meaning of the resilience concept and its operability is still not clear. The goal of this research is to study how urban engineering and design disciplines can improve resilience to floods in urban neighbourhoods. This paper presents the conceptual Spatial Decision Support System (DS3) model which we consider a relevant tool to analyse and then implement resilience into neighbourhood design. Using this model, we analyse and discuss alternative stormwater management options at the neighbourhood scale in two specific areas: Rotterdam and New Orleans. The results obtained demonstrate that the DS3 model confirmed in its framework analysis that stormwater management systems can positively contribute to the improved flood resilience of a neighbourhood.

J	Stumpp, EM				Stumpp, Eva-Maria			New in town? On resilience and "Resilient Cities"	CITIES			English	Article						Urban resilience; Sustainability; Planning theory; Environmental planning; Complexity; Trans-disciplinary research; Collaborative projects		Looking at the programme and the range of conferences in spatial planning around Europe in recent years, resilience seems to be the new buzzword in urban-regional matters. As such it is following sustainability, sometimes even used interchangeably. It is argued that, with a sound theoretical framework for an urban regional context still pending, it is difficult to apply resilience as a new paradigm to planning practice. Based on conceptual thoughts on resilience particularly in relation to the concept of sustainability, this contribution suggests that one challenge for urban regional resilience is the need for intensified collaboration between different disciplines as well as between science and practice. It concludes with suggestions on how to approach this challenge using existing platforms such as conferences or collaborative projects. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on a variety of historical examples, it argues that cities are remarkably resilience entities, and have survived and even flourished in the aftermath of horrific destruction, whether caused by human action, natural catastrophe or a combination thereof. The paper reviews historical cases of urban disaster in order to isolate important design and planning factors influencing the capacity of a city to rebound and recover. These include London Fire, 1666; the Great Fire of Chicago, 1871; Great Tangshan Earthquake, 1976; and the Mexico City Earthquake of 1985. It then focuses on the key role of a resourceful citizenry in determining post-disaster resilience. Hurricane Katrina not only devastated the built environment of New Orleans but, by forcing a mass evacuation of residents, tore apart its social fabric as well. Plans to rebuild the city's physical infrastructure have lagged in part because the social fabric and communal networks have yet to recover. Only with strong citizen involvement at the grassroots level will the rebuilding of New Orleans yield a robust and inclusive metropolis, rather than a theme-park shadow of its former self.

These circumstances oblige us to manage flood risk by integrating new concepts like urban resilience design. Definitively, our goal is to reduce flood risk by managing vulnerability issues of flooded areas to achieve flood resilient cities. A first analysis of city needs of decision-making tools showed that no tools to prioritize recovery actions are available. This tool needs to integrate some models and indicators to be efficient: an urban systemic model of the city; resilience indicators; failure and recovery scenarios. A first prototype sketch was designed but it needs to integrate these models and indicators. That is why, as part of a future PhD thesis, this tool will be developed to be used directly by decision makers and communities.

J	Godschalk, DR				Godschalk, David R.			Urban Hazard Mitigation: Creating Resilient Cities	NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW			English	Article								Cities are complex and interdependent systems, extremely vulnerable to threats from both natural hazards and terrorism. This paper proposes a comprehensive strategy of urban hazard mitigation aimed at the creation of resilient cities, able to withstand both types of threats. The paper reviews hazard mitigation practice, defines a resilient city, considers the relationship between resilience and terrorism, and discusses why resilience is important and how to apply its principles to physical and social elements of cities. Contending that current hazard mitigation policy, practice, and knowledge fail to deal with the unique aspects of cities under stress, the paper recommends a major resilient cities initiative, including expanded urban systems research, education and training, and increased collaboration among professional groups involved in city building and hazard mitigation.

As a result the dramatic urbanisation process is depleting the world's resources and the chief culprit behind climate change. Resilient cities can adapt to changes, grand challenges and can balance ecosystem and human functions. Spatial planning aims at making cities more resilient and sustainable which requires innovation, foresight, effective partnership and networks among all actors involved in urban planning processes. In practice, the implementation of these ideas is difficult because cities are dynamic structures and spatial planning processes as well as their outputs are very diverse across Europe and the world. Harmonised spatial planning information and spatial data infrastructures (SDI) encourage monitoring and more transparent planning processes. SDI can be a supportive element for spatial planning processes as it provides important harmonised data input and helps to better understand the complexity of cities and planning.

J	Guo, Y				Guo, Yan			Urban Resilience in Post-Disaster Reconstruction: Towards a Resilient Development in Sichuan, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE			English	Article						Dujiangyan; Great Sichuan Earthquake; post-disaster reconstruction; design for urban resilience		This article discusses the post-disaster urban resilience design framework in the case of post-disaster urban reconstruction in Sichuan after the Great Sichuan Earthquake (also known as the Wenchuan Earthquake) in May 2008 in China. The focus is on three main aspects of post-disaster urban reconstruction: sociospatial coherence, temporal continuity, and multistakeholder integration and communication. Critical interpretation of the government-guided reconstruction reveals that reconstruction was limited to the generic production and implementation of top-down planning. From the perspective of urban resilience, and through an alternative design scenario developed in this research, this article highlights an urban resilience design framework based on postdisaster development in the Sichuan city of Dujiangyan. By identifying the deficiencies of the governmental reconstruction where in many aspects resilience has not been considered, and by proposing the alternative where resilience has been considered to develop a better living, this research seeks to integrate urban resilience as a key aspect in the Sichuan reconstruction and as essential for developing the postdisaster city towards a more coherent, sustainable, and integral urban future.

J	Steele, WE; Gleeson, B				Steele, Wendy; Gleeson, Brendan			Mind the governance gap: oil vulnerability and urban resilience in Australian cities	AUSTRALIAN PLANNER			English	Article						oil vulnerability; governance; Australian cities		Australian cities currently face high levels of oil vulnerability, which is often unevenly distributed, particularly within the middle and outer suburbs of the greater metropolitan areas (Dodson and Sipe, 2006). New urban policies and planning practices are needed to avoid, remedy or mitigate the impacts of oil price rises and create urban resilience (Newman et al. 2009). Whilst the lack of scholarship around oil vulnerability is slowly beginning to be addressed within the Australian urban planning context, an emphasis on the links between urban governance and urban resilience is still largely marginalised despite its acknowledged central role in the quest of urban resilience. Our main point of departure is the re-conceptualisation of oil vulnerability as a planning and governance deficit within Australian cities. We identify a number of gaps that combine to inhibit the capacity for the development of urban resilience in the face of oil vulnerability and depletion scenarios.

J	Beatley, T; Newman, P				Beatley, Timothy; Newman, Peter			Biophilic Cities Are Sustainable, Resilient Cities	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						biophilic cities; sustainable cities; resilient cities	NATURAL-ENVIRONMENT; SOCIAL SUPPORT; NEARBY NATURE; HEALTH	There is a growing recognition of the need for daily contact with nature, to live happy, productive, meaningful lives. Recent attention to biophilic design among architects and designers acknowledges this power of nature. However, in an increasingly urban planet, more attention needs to be aimed at the urban scales, at planning for and moving towards what the authors call. biophilic cities.. Biophilic cities are cities that provide close and daily contact with nature, nearby nature, but also seek to foster an awareness of and caring for this nature. Biophilic cities, it is argued here, are also sustainable and resilient cities. Achieving the conditions of a biophilic city will go far in helping to foster social and landscape resilience, in the face of climate change, natural disasters and economic uncertainty and various other shocks that cities will face in the future. The paper identifies key pathways by which biophilic urbanism enhances resilience, and while some are well-established relationships, others are more tentative and suggest future research and testing.

Specifically, it argues that changing practices of resilience have emerged both as a function of time, and in relation to a range of changing socio-political and economic pressures, which have re-articulated the meaning, scale, operational role of, and responsibility for, resilience. The article seeks to critique resilience policy, raising questions about the usefulness of emerging resilience as the central organising concept for depicting how urban systems respond to contemporary and future crises.

J	Campanella, TJ				Campanella, TJ			Urban resilience and the recovery of New Orleans	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION			English	Article								This article considers the recent catastrophe in New Orleans in terms of "urban resilience," the capacity of a city to rebound from destruction. Based on a variety of historical examples, I argue that urban resilience is largely a function of resilient and resourceful citizens. Hurricane Katrina not only devastated the built environment of New Orleans but, by forcing a massive evacuation of residents, tore apart its social fabric as well. I maintain that plans to rebuild the physical infrastructure of the city must be accompanied by a commitment to rehabilitate its social fabric and communal networks. Only with strong citizen involvement at the grassroots level will the rebuilding of New Orleans yield a robust and inclusive metropolis, rather than a theme-park shadow of its former self.

This chapter explores how elements of these requirements have been achieved nationally and internationally and what more needs to be done to achieve resilient cities in Australia.

This article lays a foundation for discussing transitions in urban governance, which enable cities to navigate change, build capacity to withstand shocks, and use experimentation and innovation in face of uncertainty. Using the three concrete case cities-New Orleans, Cape Town, and Phoenix-the article analyzes thresholds and cross-scale interactions, and expands the scale at which urban resilience has been discussed by integrating the idea from geography that cities form part of "system of cities" (i.e., they cannot be seen as single entities). Based on this, the article argues that urban governance need to harness social networks of urban innovation to sustain ecosystem services, while nurturing discourses that situate the city as part of regional ecosystems. The article broadens the discussion on urban resilience while challenging resilience theory when addressing human-dominated ecosystems. Practical examples of harnessing urban innovation are presented, paired with an agenda for research and policy.

J	Coaffee, J				Coaffee, Jon			Towards Next-Generation Urban Resilience in Planning Practice: From Securitization to Integrated Place Making	PLANNING PRACTICE AND RESEARCH			English	Article						resilience; planning; security; place-making; localism	TERRORISM; CHALLENGES; POLITICS; CITIES; LONDON; RISK; CITY	Resilience is a concept incorporating a vast range of contemporary risks and over recent years has become increasingly important to our understanding of contemporary planning policy and practice. This paper examines the changing nature of resilience strategies since 2000 and highlights how planners increasingly are asked to contribute to this agenda. Drawing on the emerging theories of urban resilience, this paper charts the emergence of different 'styles' of resilience over the last decade in the UK, with an emphasis on a range of policies associated with designing safer spaces. Emerging lessons are then deployed to highlight how a new generation of urban resilience practice is now emerging associated with embedding resiliency into local place-making activities. This paper concludes by reflecting upon the multiple uses of resilience in planning practice.

J	Pilav, A				Pilav, Armina			Before the War, War, After the War: Urban Imageries for Urban Resilience	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE			English	Article						patterns of urban resilience; Sarajevo; urban conditions; urban imageries; war		This article discusses urban conditions in cities that in their recent history experienced war. It puts the social component of the city into relationship with the destroyed and dangerous urban environment. In the period between 1992 and 1996 in Sarajevo and in other Bosnian cities, survival became the most important activity for citizens. In the period directly preceding the war, urban conditions-mobility, infrastructure, and services-started to malfunction. As a result, ordinary city life became an object of new urban imageries influenced by new urban conditions and rules of behavior. The first bombing of the city on 6 April 1992 was a sign that the war had started. It brought with it war urban conditions: lack of public transport, electricity, water, and food. The inability of the city and the people living in it to function normally demanded new patterns of urban resilience, which were partly a product of the city's prewar conditions. Using Sarajevo as a case study, this article examines whether the city had predisaster coping strategies and, if so, the extent to which these plans were used during the war. Finally, the article observes how citizens, with their own imageries about cities, can participate in the creation of patterns of urban resilience and future predisaster strategies.

Placing collaborative governance at centre stage, this paper explores how best to develop resilient cities based on best practice and innovative design. After researching best practice stakeholder collaboration, this paper analyses the common themes that characterize climate adaptation strategies, and documents the success factors typifying best practice. Based on this research and experience, it outlines the IFOK model for new governance and supporting institutional strategies. In addition, the paper argues that a more radical redesign of engagement and governance will be critical in order to achieve community resilience and joint action. It outlines how this can be achieved through collaborative governance, involving the deliberated wisdom of ordinary citizens, i.e. by instituting deliberative democracy. Examples of deliberative democratic practice across the globe are highlighted, including an innovative initiative to develop a deliberative community and collaborative governance in regional Western Australia.

At the same time the emergence and advancement of megacities will be explored in the context of the current processes of urbanization, globalization, and metropolization. It will be argued that a "hazards perspective" on major cities needs to be complemented by a focus on the potential of these cities, i.e., on hope, creativity, and urban resilience. Overall, it is concluded that city size is not necessarily an obstacle to sustainability.

Urban resilience and national security: the role for planning	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-URBAN DESIGN AND PLANNING			English	Article						buildings; structures & design; disaster engineering; safety & hazards		In recent years, the activity of protecting against and planning responses to the wide range of security challenges that threaten cities and urban areas-from natural disasters such as flooding and anthropogenic climate change to crime and terrorism-has been referred to as 'urban resilience'. In this sense, urban resilience refers to both the design alterations (structural, architectural, land-use planning) and managerial and governance measures that seek to prevent or mitigate the physical and social vulnerability of areas, ultimately to protect life, property and economic activity. Against this background, this paper analyses attempts to embed physical and managerial resilience in urban areas to counter the risk from terrorist attacks. Specifically, it highlights the expanded role for the spatial planning system in meeting and mediating pressures for increased safety and security. Drawing on historical examples, but paying particular attention to the current UK context, the paper details how the planning profession is becoming more responsible for counter-terrorism; this is leading not only to requirements for further training but also to concerns regarding efficacy. This work also questions how proportionate the pressures to achieve counter-terrorism resilience are, particularly given the higher likely incidence and impact of natural disasters.

Harvesting urban resources towards more resilient cities	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Urban metabolism; Urban harvest; Resources management; Urban energy; Urban water; Urban planning	BUILT ENVIRONMENT; WATER; METABOLISM; SUSTAINABILITY; MANAGEMENT; INFRASTRUCTURE; ECOLOGY; DESIGN; ENERGY; CITY	With accelerating global changes, cities have to cope with growing pressures, especially for resource supply. Cities may be considered as resources reservoirs and producers of secondary resources. This paper introduces the concept of urban harvesting as a management tool to change inefficient linear urban resource usage and waste production into sustainable urban metabolism. The Urban Harvest concept includes urban metabolism and closing urban cycles by harvesting urban resources. The purpose of this study was to quantify the potentials to harvest water and energy at different scales. We investigated potentials for the Netherlands. Results show that at national scale, potentials can cover up to 100% of electricity demand, 55% of heat demand and 52% of tap water demand. At neighborhood level, similar percentages were found for energy. Only 43% of water demand was achieved, due to fact that treatment measures were not considered. These results indicate the large potential of cities as providers of their own resources. Therefore urban resources management is a key element of future city design towards more resilient cities.

J	Monteiro, A; Carvalho, V; Velho, S; Sousa, C				Monteiro, Ana; Carvalho, Vania; Velho, Sara; Sousa, Carlos			Assessing and monitoring urban resilience using COPD in Porto	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						COPD; Urban form; Social and environmental inequalities index (SEII); Multi-criteria hierarchical analysis	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; HEALTH; SUSCEPTIBILITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Background: COPD morbidity is a good example of how the urban form may interfere with a disease's severity. Then, it may play an important role as a stimulus to increase the acceptability of several policy actions that aim to upgrade urban resilience. Despite the multiple dimensions of wellbeing, health is surely a key variable attracting everyone's attention, which is thus more likely to be able to persuade people that actions that may at first seem undesirable are fundamental in improving urban sustainability and well-being. Methods: After creating a short list of socio-economic and environmental factors relating to the onset and aggravation of COPD, daily admissions distributions were compared using both a non-weighted and a weighted multi-criteria hierarchical analysis procedure. Results: Porto's COPD Social and Environmental Inequalities Index (SEII), calculated with a hierarchical analysis procedure, accurately illustrates a great relationship between COPD admissions and adverse urban form variables. Conclusion: COPD may be an important communication tool to stimulate the acceptability of some otherwise unpopular planning measures to improve urban resilience (sustainability and well-being).

J	Lu, PW; Stead, D				Lu, Peiwen; Stead, Dominic			Understanding the notion of resilience in spatial planning: A case study of Rotterdam, The Netherlands	CITIES			English	Article						Water management; Spatial planning; Resilience; Rotterdam; The Netherlands	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERSPECTIVE; STABILITY; POLICY	The notions of urban resilience and the resilient city have gained considerable attention and interest over recent years, not only in relation to environmental management but also in terms of urban planning. The notion of urban resilience is not just confined to academic discourses - it is increasingly prevalent in urban policy documents. This paper examines awareness and understanding of urban resilience in the planning policy arena in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where planning has a long history of managing water. Specific attention in the paper is paid to the issue of climate change and how planning processes in the city consider or deal with the risks that it presents. The ways in which the city assesses and prepares for these risks or threats form the two main areas of analysis. The paper concludes that evidence of resilient thinking can be found at all levels of decision-making, ranging from the transnational to local levels. However, the notion of resilience is still quite fuzzy and its significance can vary substantially between policy officials and between policy documents, sometimes even within the same administration.

TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ecosystem services (ES); urban resilience (UR); informal housing; Istanbul; Sultanbeyli	PERSPECTIVE	As estimated by UN, in 2030, 95 % of population growth will result from urban areas while a few metropolitan areas of rapidly growing developing countries will absorb much of this growth. Due to the accelerated urban growth and uncontrolled urban dispersion through naturally significant areas, sustainable urban growth management becomes a critical urban development policy for the global agenda. Istanbul has been attracting much of the internal migration with a dramatic urban growth process since 1950s and Istanbul Province, with over 12 million people in 2010, is the most populated city of Turkey. Sultanbeyli, as a unique case for informal housing development in Istanbul, expanded like mushrooming after 1980's and located itself on the largest drinking water source of Istanbul: the Omerli Watershed. The population of the Sultanbeyli District grew from 82,298 (1990 census) to 272,758 people (2007 census) (TUIK, 1990; 2007): more than threefold increase in less than two decades with consequent environmental degradation, uncontrolled ground water pumping, lack of drinking and waste water infrastructures. These factors endanger the well-being of the environment and of the society. On the other hand, the serious poverty problem is the main concern in Sultanbeyli for urban resilience (UR) which can be defined as the degree to which cities are able to tolerate alteration before reorganizing around a new set of structures and processes and which can be measured by how well a city can simultaneously balance ecosystem services (ES) and human functions (Resilience Alliance, 2007). This paper aims to discuss how to integrate ecosystem services and resilience theory which will be essential to resolve the problems reflected by social, economic and administrative characteristics of the Sultanbeyli District to enhance its urban resilience capacity in Istanbul.

Protecting the NFL/militarizing the homeland: Citizen soldiers and urban resilience in post-9/11 America	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR THE SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT			English	Article						battlespace; government contractor defense; NFL; post-9; 11 America; SAFETY Act; urban resilience; US Department of Homeland Security	SPORTS	In this article I focus on intersections between the National Football League's (NFL) security practices and the US Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) counter-terrorism agenda, including new policies and legal structures that support pre-emption, protection, and preparation activities that manage and mitigate the effects of terrorist attacks. As I will argue, the intensifying and mutually supportive relationship between the NFL and the various forces employed to keep it safe is both unique in US sports and implies the militarization of football fans in somewhat unexpected ways. I will argue that the security strategies of the US government and those of the NFL are mutually beneficial in ways that help secure the NFL's position and profitability and, more importantly, help implement and secure consensus for the US Department of Homeland Security's continued 'war on terror'. Coaffee's recent work on urban resilience in the UK (Coaffee, 2009; Coaffee and Wood, 2006) contends that in the present historical moment, 'security is becoming more civic, urban, domestic, and personal' (Coaffee, 2009: 9). How, if at all, does resilience play out in the context of anti-terrorism policy in post-9/11 America? How, if at all, does US professional football articulate with that policy? These are two key questions I intend to address during the course of this article.

J	Galderisi, A; Ferrara, FF				Galderisi, Adriana; Ferrara, Floriana Federica			ENHANCING URBAN RESILIENCE IN FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE<SUP>1</SUP>. A Methodological Approach	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						urban resilience; adaptation; climate change		Climate change can be considered as one of the main environmental topic of the 21st century (IPCC, 2011). It poses a serious challenge for cities all over the world (EEA, 2012): cities show, on the one hand a high level of vulnerability in face of climate change, on the other hand, they are responsible for 60% to 80% of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which represent the main causes of change in climate conditions. In 2011, the 73% of European population was living in urban areas and the level of urbanization is expected to be at 82% by 2050 (UN, 2012). Due to the evidence that in Europe the 69% of all GHG emissions are currently generated by cities, larger and larger is the attention devoted, by scientific literature and policy makers, to outline strategies for urban adaptation to climate change, both at European and local scale. Governments and scholars currently highlight the need for strengthening urban resilience in face of climate change and related consequences. By this perspective, some actions are already running, even though a clear identification of the features which make a city resilient in face of climate change is still missing. To fill this gap, this contribution is mainly addressed to: provide, by integrating different disciplinary perspectives, a conceptual model of the set of adaptive capacities and properties that characterize a resilient system; verify, starting from a snapshot of current strategies and actions for urban adaptation currently implemented at European level, the consistency between those strategies and the identified set of resilience capacities and properties.

J	Colucci, A				Colucci, Angela			TOWARDS RESILIENT CITIES COMPARING APPROACHES/STRATEGIES	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Resilience; Urban Planning; Risk Mitigation		The term "resilience" is used in many disciplines with different meanings. We will adopt the ecological concept of resilience, which epitomises the capacity of a system to adapt itself in response to the action of a force, achieving a state of equilibrium different from the original (White, 2011). Since the end of the last century, with a significant increase over the last few years, resilience has featured as key concept in many technical, political papers and documents, and appears in many researches. Of all this recent and varied range of literature, our focus is on those texts that combine resilience with strategies, processes and models for resilient cities, communities and regions. Starting from the resilience strategies developed as response for risks mitigation, the paper thus explores other approaches and experiences on cities resilience that have been conducted: the aim is to compare and identify innovation in the planning process towards risks mitigation. In this paper we present a summary of the initial survey stage of our research, with three main aims: understanding the approaches to resilience developed so far and identifying which aspects these approaches share (or not); - understanding which strategies are being proposed for resilient regions, cities or social ecological systems; - understanding whether proposed resilience strategies involve innovations in urban and regional development disciplines. The aim is to understand whether the proposed concept of resilience, or rather strategies, constitute progress and contribute to innovation in the areas of urban planning and design in relation to risk mitigation.

J	Dieleman, H				Dieleman, Hans			Organizational learning for resilient cities, through realizing eco-cultural innovations	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Climate change; Resilient cities; Organizational learning; Artful doing; Eco-cultural innovations; Educational methodology		This article is about cities and climate change, and about ways to make cities more resilient to the effects of climate change. It presents the two dominant strategies of mitigation and adaptation, and goes on to present a systems view on the city in which resilience is the key response to climate change. The article argues that resilience depends on three dimensions or areas: a city's physical form, infrastructure and technology, its people and particular multilevel governance, levels of human connectedness and communal self-reliance, and the innovative capacity as well as the level of inclusion of marginalized groups within the economy. Teaching and training is seen as an important element in strengthening resilience, and the article presents a number of case studies showing the relevance of learning processes as conditions to work successfully in urban networks in the areas mentioned. The article takes organizational learning as its main orientation and presents important concepts such as "reflective action", "learning by doing", "mental maps", the "experiential learning cycle" and the "5 disciplines of the learning organization". This forms the base for the design of concrete educational material. This material is centered on a number of eco-cultural innovations: concrete ideas, technologies, systems or activities that focus on neighborhood-based activities that reinforce the local economy or introduce small-scale technology for water, renewable energy or waste.

This suggests that action to reduce exposure and improve the adaptive capacity of urban populations must therefore simultaneously address disaster risk reduction, urban poverty reduction and urban resilience (i.e. the ability of the city to maintain the functions that support the well-being of its citizens). Based on evidence and experience from 10 cities which form part of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (www.acccrn.org), this article proposes that a simplified conceptual model and resilience characteristics be used to analyse urban systems, in parallel with spatial analysis, to target action at multiple levels to reduce exposure and improve the adaptive capacity of urban populations simultaneously.

Furthermore, most studies on the subject make use of general, vague, and confusing terminology. This paper suggests a new innovative conceptual framework (the Resilient City Planning Framework or RCPF) that addresses the critical question of what cities and their urban communities should do in order to move towards a more resilient state in the future. Accordingly, the RCPF takes complexity and uncertainty into account. It is affected by a multiplicity of economic, social, spatial, and physical factors and its planning involves a wide range of stakeholders. RCPF is a network of four interlinked concepts that together, provide a comprehensive understanding of City Resilience. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper deals with the concept of urban seismic vulnerability, and introduces resilience, as the capacity of a system to adapt itself to new, generally negative, conditions, in order to re-establish normal conditions. Each city can express resilience, and the identification of its elements is the goal of our research. A spatial multi-criteria approach is here proposed.

J	Wamsler, C				Wamsler, C.			Achieving urban resilience: understanding and tackling disasters from a local perspective	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-URBAN DESIGN AND PLANNING			English	Article						developing countries; safety & hazards		The damage caused by a dramatic worldwide increase in so-called natural disasters is staggering, with the poor in developing countries being most at risk. This paper analyses: (a) the key variables and their causal relations that underlie the complex system of risk and disaster occurrence in slums; (b) the impacts of disasters on slums; (c) the strategies used by local people to cope with risk and disasters; and (d) the reasons for weak coping. The views and knowledge of slum dwellers in El Salvador are the focus of this analysis. On this basis, five complementary ex ante risk-reduction measures have been identified and developed to match local needs, capacities and dimensions of risk-hazard reduction (or prevention), mitigation, preparedness, risk 'financing' and stand-by for recovery. The complementary measures provide a frame of reference that allows urban development actors to systematically search for and design potential risk reduction measures. It is concluded that keeping these measures compartmentalised and separate from each other during planning and implementation of urban development programmes helps ensure both sustainable poverty reduction and urban resilience.

While much is known about how to make urban regions safer, political and economic calculations often overwhelm these considerations. The mix of competing priorities and incentives of federal, state, and local officials conspire to make urban hazard planning difficult if not impossible. The considerable challenge facing those charged with making cities less vulnerable is to strike an appropriate balance between these political and economic dynamics, and the creation of more disaster-resilient communities.

Currently the concept of habitability has become an important tool in design and construction. Population growth and climate change affect this factor. Poorly designed buildings do not meet new environmental conditions and do not act in response to resource availability. Therefore, the change in living conditions should trigger the design of resilient cities and buildings, to provide adequate solutions to these phenomena. The article proposes a model that allows for innovation in the design of resilient buildings and cities, as well as for software for evaluating and guiding design variables towards habitability as a sustainability factor. The article concludes applying a proposal specifically to Bogota's conditions.

In some instances, these recommendations are appropriate. However, since many are drawn from traditional approaches to comprehensive planning and from climate mitigation programs, they often do not account for the unique challenges associated with urban adaptation or provide guidance that is sensitive to the distinctive social, cultural, institutional, and administrative characteristics of particular locales. In this paper, which captures a panel discussion convened at the Resilient Cities Congress 2010, expert practitioners and academics review emerging wisdom about best practices in adaptation planning, draw on their experience and research findings to challenge these assumptions, and show what we can learn about process and outcomes from cities at the forefront.

Designers and planners depend on experience, craft, and environmental knowledge to shape preferred futures. Ecological literacy would enhance the design and planning of built environments. The concepts of "resilience" and "ecosystem" offer opportunities for collaboration between ecologists and practitioners in the design and planning disciplines. Urban resilience to natural disasters and coastal green infrastructure represent two areas where design and planning based on ecological principles should be applied. The Sustainable Sites Initiative is a practical example of interdisciplinary collaboration.

It is clear that diversity plays a pivotal role in the resilience building of ecosystems; however, it is less clear what role cultural diversity plays in the resilience building of urban systems. In this paper we provide innovative insights on how common property systems could contribute to urban resilience building. Through a review of recent findings on urban common property systems and the relevant literature, we deal with urban green commons (UGCs) and discuss their potential to manage cultural and biological diversity in cities. We describe three examples of UGCs, i.e. collectively managed parks, community gardens, and allotment areas, with a focus on their institutional characteristics, their role in promoting diverse learning streams, environmental stewardship, and social ecological memory. We discuss how UGCs can facilitate cultural integration through civic participation in urban land-management, conditions for the emergence of UGCs, the importance of cognitive resilience building, and what role property-rights diversity plays in urban settings. We conclude by elucidating some key insights on how UGCs can promote urban resilience building. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The hurricane constituted a triggering event, but the severe destruction and heavy losses documented the extraordinary costs of inadequate plans and practice, given the city's high exposure to risk. This condition and its sobering consequences are not limited to New Orleans, but constitute a silent threat for other cities in the United States and the world. The challenge for cities is to create a new vision of vital, resilient communities that are able to assess and manage their own risk in order to limit escalating damage from extreme events.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the challenges underpinning the problem of environmental degradation in cities. It then briefly considers available initiatives that can be implemented toward the realization of more sustainable cities. A case is made for the possible contribution of the UNESCO biosphere reserve concept as a useful urban management tool. Findings - Urban administrators have a range of tools to select from to support the design and management of sustainable cities. It is argued that the UNESCO biosphere reserve concept is potentially a very valuable tool, although, apart from academic studies, not truly tested in an urban context. Originality/value - Biological diversity is the very essence that sustains life on earth and forms the basis of quality living conditions, even within built-up areas. Today, cities are facing the pressures of increasing populations and the effects thereof on the environment. The challenge facing cities is how to improve the quality of life of all city dwellers amidst the environmental challenge of dwindling natural resources. The paper looks at a number of initiatives available to city administrators in their quest to create liveable cities. It is perhaps timeous to research the potential applicability of the biosphere reserve framework as an urban tool toward more resilient, environmentally acceptable urban landscapes.

Relocalising disaster risk reduction for urban resilience	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-URBAN DESIGN AND PLANNING			English	Article						disaster engineering; education & training; local government		'Relocalisation' is defined as aiming to return communities to a more local basis, including in disaster risk reduction. In 2005, Boulder Valley, Colorado, USA formed a non-profit, non-governmental organisation to implement relocalisation. In late 2006 and early 2007, the group's leaders decided to pursue relocalisation as a for-profit venture and effectively eliminated disaster risk reduction from the relocalisation agenda. This paper analyses these actions and the consequences for relocalisation through the framework of good governance, which involves the principles of participation, transparency, accountability, rule of law, effectiveness and equity.

Sustainable urban agriculture: stocktake and opportunities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						economic; institutions; legal; resilience; scale; social	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HEALTH; MALARIA; SYSTEMS; HEAT; DETERMINANTS; WETLANDS; ISLANDS; GARDENS; HARARE	This paper reviews research on urban agriculture which relates to the three dimensions of sustainability: social, economic and environmental. We propose that urban agriculture has three elements: urban agriculture in isolation; its interface with the people and environment within which it is situated; and its contribution to the design of built form. Additionally, we consider its scale: micro, meso and macro. The analysis draws attention to legal, social and economic constraints and opportunities. It suggests that future priorities for research should be directed towards (i) strategically identifying principles of sustainable urban agriculture that help policy makers to design resilient cities, e.g. using flood-prone areas for food and employment, and (ii) operationally trialling innovative institutional mechanisms, e.g. differential land taxes to support sustainable urban agriculture or payments for environmental services provided by urban agriculture such as carbon sequestration.

Interdisciplinary programs that embody these shared values and work towards these shared goals are emerging, including school-based health centers, full-service community schools, community health centers, Promise Neighborhoods, and Choice Neighborhoods. The intersection of these three fields represents an opportunity to intervene on social determinants of health. More collaborative research and practice across public health, education, and planning should build from the shared values identified to continue to address these common goals.

J	Antrobus, D				Antrobus, Derek			Smart green cities: from modernization to resilience?	URBAN RESEARCH & PRACTICE			English	Article						city regions; climate change; ecological modernization; resilience		It is possible to detect a shift in the way we think about environmental issues, in particular climate change, from what academics call 'ecological modernization' to what can be termed 'resilient cities'. This is both a consequence and a cause of city regions emerging as the pragmatic scale of governance. This article will use a case study of Greater Manchester in the northwest of England to show how thinking on the environment was centred around 'ecological modernization' with an emphasis on business opportunities associated with a move to a low-carbon economy. It will argue that this approach has been enhanced by a new focus on resilience. The case study will use examples of the Ecocities project, green infrastructure and flood risk to show how a concern for resilience has emerged. It will then revisit the issue of energy to show how the new concerns have influenced the low-carbon strategy.

With their high degree of interdependency, urban networks and services are critical issues for the resilience of a city. And yet, network managers are scarcely aware of their flaws and dependencies and they are reluctant to take them into account. In order to develop an operational tool to improve urban resilience, we propose here an auto-diagnosis method to be completed by network managers.

INSIGHTS INTO THE ROLE OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES DISASTER MITIGATION STRATEGIES	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Critical infrastructures; metropolitan and urban areas; resilience; essential services		Critical infrastructures (CI) systems provide essential services "for the maintenance of critical societal functions, including the supply chain, health, safety, security and economic or social well-being of the people" (European Commission, 2008). These systems are exposed to a great number of hazards and threats, which may result in severe consequences for the population, the socioeconomic system, and the environment. The issue is particularly relevant at urban level, where the disruption of one CI system can propagate to the other systems and paralyze the entire area. It is therefore necessary, not only to protect CIs through Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) strategies, but also to enhance the resilience of these areas. This article aims thus at providing some insights related to the evolution of the critical infrastructures disaster mitigation strategies from the sole protection towards resilience: what kind of strategies based on resilience can be developed to address CIs disruption at local or regional level? To what extent do these strategies contribute to increase the resilience level of the entire urban or metropolitan area? The first section focuses on the urban critical infrastructures systems as well as on the way their disruption can impact urban areas. The second section provides with some examples of key measures to operationalize resilience in the field of critical infrastructure disaster mitigation strategies. The last section highlights how the key measures developed to enhance the resilience against CI disruptions can benefit also to broader urban resilience.

In examining how experiments take effect, we suggest that we need to understand not only how they are made and assembled, but also how they are maintained within specific urban contexts. Drawing on literatures from urban political ecology and the specific debate on urban repair and maintenance, this article examines maintenance in two case studies of climate change experiments in housing in Bangalore (India) and Monterrey (Mexico). We find that maintenance is a crucial process through which not only urban obduracy is preserved, but also the novel and innovative character of the experiment is asserted and reproduced. The process of maintaining' experiments is a precarious one, which requires a continuous external input in terms of remaking the experiment materially and discursively. This process causes further reconfigurations beyond the experiment, changing the patterns of responsibility attribution and acceptability that configure the urban fabric.

Planning for resilience to the impacts of stressors within cities requires an evaluation of the vulnerable components of cities, an understanding of the key processes, procedures, and interactions that organize these components and develop the capacity to address various structuring of components and their interactions with the ultimate goal of achieving resilience. This paper provides a deeper look at resilience in cities, proposes a conceptual resilience framework, and includes a discussion and analysis of the framework. The proposed framework is meant to serve as a more holistic approach to designing, planning, and managing for resilience by including an evaluation of cultural and process dynamics within cities as well as their physical elements.

The primary unit of analysis is the US Census tract (N=1660), nested within 31 incorporated places spanning five US states. The dependent variable is an estimate of clearance time in hours derived using network analysis techniques within a geographic information system. We find that tracts with a more peripheral location, more female residents, a higher proportion of Hispanic residents, and higher median household incomes are associated with higher clearance times, on average. Our research suggests the relationship between suburbanization and clearance time is complex and evolving, mediated by past investments in the built environment and shifting social conditions. In addition to facilitating the evacuation of areas with low access to personal vehicles, urban planners and emergency management officials should also consider how the degree of connectivity in the street network impacts congestion and clearance time.

Though concern for integrating disaster risk management approaches into development planning has been expressed in various policy documents and studies, exact methods of such integration at the spatial level are still being deliberated. The concepts of quality of life (QoL) and disaster resiliency are closely linked and their interrelationship is understood from the definitions and concepts developed in different studies. A disaster can have a negative impact on QoL and resiliency for disaster can protect and maintain QoL. This study develops an approach for integrating disaster resiliency into QoL based on new urbanization models, which can be re-orientated towards achieving resiliency. The Quality of Life with Disaster Resiliency (QoLDR) index offers the integration of resiliency issues arising from the urbanization process as well as natural hazards. It also provides directions for altering urbanization and increases adaptability, which results in resilient urbanization.

Managing this risk requires effective climate adaptation policies - strategic courses of action designed to strengthen urban resilience to climate-related stress. City governments have a key role to play in adaptation policy design, but they appear to face challenges in marshalling political commitment and technical capacity. This article examines elements of urban climate adaptation policy targeting extreme weather and analyzes the policy development process in two major Canadian cities, Toronto and Halifax.

African cities already face huge demands with regard to human health and urban sustainability, and global environmental change will increase these challenges, making it even more imperative that human health and urban sustainability are simultaneously addressed in locally appropriate ways. Key areas of intersection include increased temperatures, drought, flooding, the decreased ability of ecosystems to provide health-enhancing services (clean air, water and soil) and increasing urban food insecurity. There are a range or strategies that can be used to improve urban resilience and sustainability while simultaneously improving human health. The key challenge, however, is transforming African urban governance systems, so that objectives such as sustainability and improved health can be met.

Although there is some disagreement among these different literatures about how to define and measure resilience, there is broad consensus that: (1) cities must become resilient to a wider range of shocks and stresses in order to be prepared for climate change; and (2) efforts to foster climate change resilience must be bundled with efforts to promote urban development and sustainability. Emerging issues for future study highlight some of the challenges associated with practical application of resilience approaches. These include responding to equity concerns associated with uneven patterns of resilience both within and across cities, assessing the costs of implementing resilience strategies, and identifying options for harnessing the innovation potential in cities as a means to foster resilience and sustainability.

Urban Metabolism and the Energy Stored in Cities Implications for Resilience	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						energy cycling; energy stock; industrial ecology; residence time; urban metabolism; vulnerability	HONG-KONG; AREA	Using the city of Toronto as a case study, this article examines impacts of energy stocks and flexible demand in the urban metabolism on the resilience of the city, including discussion of directions for further study of the resiliency of the urban metabolism. An important element developed is the nominal residence time of the energy stocks. This value defines how long an energy stock lasts under typical patterns of energy use. The findings suggest that the residence times of many sources of energy overcome vulnerability when energy supply shocks last on the order of hours or a few days, but that the measure is limited to assessing only certain types of commonly used energy sources in aggregate terms. Discussion is included on the uncertainty of this measure and on the metabolic and resiliency implications of new technologies intended to reduce energy use and improve sustainability of cities and the use of the urban metabolism as a means of comparison. The methodology employed highlights how waste energy could be used to increase the resiliency of the city's water supply, but also how the study of the urban metabolism would benefit from a more disaggregate form in the study of sustainable and resilient cities.

Management of land use sprawl in urban area especially in developing countries using GIS and Remote sensing tools still in vague although these tool may provide the benefit on fundamental observations of urban encroachment and environmental monitoring that are not available from other sources (Batty and Howes, 2001). Therefore, this paper attempts to analyze the capability and reviewing the research and works done recently on GIS and remote sensing in managing urban land use sprawl in developing countries in order to increase the resilience of cities with diverse dynamics. Design/methodology/approach - Increasing availability of GIS and remotely sensed application on urban planning purposes can be seen on capabilities of broad spatial coverage, capacity of routine and unobtrusive updating and the ability to provide self-consistent measurement will be consider as a main indicator in the process of analyzing and reviewing for works have been done. The quantitative and qualitative data analyzed using statistical approach were used in identifying the main success and failures of each study, and the main underlying reasons with comparing the result obtained for the different places in developing countries. An integrated various subsystem allows the analysis of GIS and remote sensing on urban land use sprawl to generate the result of how they manage the urban land use sprawl in further provide number of solid contribution to the wider theoretical debate on this study contexts. Originality/value - This paper represents an attempt to compare and evaluate and determine a degree of synthesize the work that has been done to develop and embed creativity and innovation of space technologies in the urban planning development. The methodology puts in evidence the strength and ability of knowledge on information system for intellectual capital and management especially for urban planning development (Mohd Noor and Hashim, 2009a and 2009b). It relates to recent development of GIS and remote sensing in urban planning which prove that the tool has a value of incorporating the complexity and dynamic of urban area into virtual with consider the relevant mechanism which highly have potential value in real world in terms of micro and macro level. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application entail mostly the theoretical and practical implication on urban development which should take the effect of land use sprawl and try to manage the phenomena with controlling the encroachment and limit the sprawl with using GIS and Remote Sensing in urban area which further can facilitate the organisation and cities in managing the land use sprawl phenomena recently hit the city in developing countries (Wu, 2006).

Urban infostructures play a crucial role within these processes, interfacing between a city's ecological, social, technical, economic and political networks. Against this backdrop, this paper discusses the governance and design of urban infostructures from a socio-technical systems perspective. It, therefore, reviews pertinent technology components, as well as institutional and discursive frameworks and their respective influence on the identification and assessment of vulnerabilities and resilience building in cities. It concludes that approaches to developing urban infostructures should be a major concern when addressing urban resilience. There is a need to fully account for the hybrid character of urban infostructures as socio-technical systems, while also seizing opportunities for targeted transformation.

Urban vulnerability and resilience within the context of climate change	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article								Natural hazards, due to climate change, are particularly damaging in urban areas because of interdependencies of their networks. So, urban resilience has to face up to climate risks. The most impacting phenomenon is the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The storage capacity of heat is depending on shapes of buildings, public spaces, spatial organization, transport or even industrial activities. So, adaptive strategies for improving urban climate could be possible in different ways. In the framework of the French project Resilis, this study characterises urban vulnerability and resilience in terms of energy needs of buildings and outside urban comfort according to the IPCC carbon dioxide emission scenarios B2 and A2 for the period 2050-2100 for 10 French cities. The evolutions of four climate indicators in terms of heating and cooling needs and number of hours when the temperature is above 28 degrees C are then obtained for each city to analyse climate risks and their impacts in urban environment.

J	Schuetze, T; Chelleri, L				Schuetze, Thorsten; Chelleri, Lorenzo			Integrating Decentralized Rainwater Management in Urban Planning and Design: Flood Resilient and Sustainable Water Management Using the Example of Coastal Cities in The Netherlands and Taiwan	WATER			English	Article						climate change; flooding; freshwater scarcity; decentralized rainwater management; climate resilience; urban development; Almere; Hsingchu	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRANSFORMABILITY; ADAPTABILITY; ADAPTATION; IMPACT	Urbanized delta areas worldwide share a growing tendency of exposure to water stress induced by the effects of climate change and anthropogenic factors, threatening the operation of infrastructure systems and future urban development. The important synergistic impacts coexisting with freshwater scarcity are increasing urbanization rates, subsiding soils, saltwater intrusion in aquifers and rivers, coastal erosion, and increased flooding. Innovative design strategies and concepts for the integration of decentralized rainwater management measures can contribute to the integrated and climate resilient planning of urban spaces that are threatened by climate change scenarios that worsen the security of urban infrastructures and the future availability of fresh water. Decentralized rainwater management, including retention, storage, and reuse strategies that are integrated into spatial planning and urban design, can reduce flood risks while simultaneously enhancing freshwater availability. This paper discusses a paradigm shift in urban water management, from centralized to decentralized management (that is, from threats to opportunities), using the example of two case studies. Concepts and strategies for building climate resilient cities, which address flood control, the protection of freshwater resources, and the harmonization of a natural and more sustainable water balance, are presented for Almere (Rhine Schelde Delta, The Netherlands) and Hsingchu (Dotzpu Delta, Taiwan).

The UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction program is asking cities 'How resilient is your city'. The ITA Committee on Underground Space (ITACUS) is working together with UNISDR to demonstrate how the use of underground space can contribute to making cities more resilient. The use of underground space is underrated worldwide, yet it can prove to be invaluable to city governments as a strategic planning asset. This paper explores the issues and shows how underground space is already contributing. The main focus will be on those aspects that help cities cope with rapid urbanization and their efforts to become more resilient. Areas which will be explored include buildings, transport, energy supply, water and waste. The question will also be raised whether the use of underground space can take place as an autonomous activity or whether planning the use of underground space is required. In the opinion of the author the latter is the case. City governments require awareness of both the advantages of underground space use but also of the need to plan using this asset in a sustainable way. Only in that way will the use of underground space be to the advantage of cities.

It examines whether current planning processes shaping vulnerable coastal settlements in Australia are sufficiently informed to build adaptive capacity for their communities under climate change impacts. Considerable research to date has focused on the application of risk management in identifying vulnerabilities and predicted worst-case scenarios. This approach often proposes 'hard' infrastructure changes for climate change adaptation. However, little work has been done looking at the processes for implementing and supporting such adaptation strategies while addressing the inherent uncertainty of future climate change impacts. This so-called 'soft' infrastructure is critical to building a community's ability to innovate and prosper while adapting to unforeseen challenges posed by a changing climate. It is argued that introducing concepts of resilience to municipal planning processes for vulnerable coastal settlements, particularly in development control plans (DCP's) may provide a more comprehensive approach to climate change adaptation.

Implications for addressing poverty and vulnerability	URBAN CLIMATE			English	Article						Urban climate resilience; Poverty; Vulnerability; Systems	PERSPECTIVES; ADAPTATION; CAPACITY; ECOLOGY; POOR	This paper considers how development policy concerns for poverty reduction and social justice can be accommodated in emerging theories and practice on urban resilience and adaptation in response to climate change. There is growing interest in applying resilience to address the challenges of urban climate change. The application of resilience theory has considerable potential for furthering our understanding of the particulars of urban climate vulnerability with its emphasis on complex systems that are increasingly important to urban life. But there are also significant risks. Resilience theory does not adequately address critical issues of power, voice and equity. Moreover, much of the uptake of resilience is as a buzzword rather than a conceptual framework. As such, the discourse of resilience has connotations that can run counter to interests of poverty reduction. Drawing on experience in Asia, the authors argue for a critical application of resilience, with special attention to concerns of resilience for and by whom. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although risks, disasters and crises are inherent to human existence, the speed, frequency and scale at which they occur today are unprecedented. Natural disasters related to global warming have increased in the last decade. Although climate change is considered a global problem, its impacts are felt locally. Cities, then, must respond earlier and more effectively to risks and hazards. Although both 'resilience thinking' and 'community based adaptation' have made headway, they have been mainly applied to rural areas and natural resource management at regional levels within social-ecological systems. This paper applies the lessons of resilience thinking and experiences in community-based adaptation efforts to urban areas. The paper argues that participatory knowledge management systems can enhance resilience in urban areas. Participatory knowledge management systems equip stakeholders at the local level to deal more effectively with sudden change, risks, and long-term stresses. Simultaneously, they can foster social capital and trust, strategic leadership, and enhance collective competence - all important components of resilient systems.

A dimensionless methodology developed based on a water balance model at daily temporal scale was applied to determine both the obtainable water saving due to the use of rain water for toilet flushing (i.e. reduce the use of portable water) and meanwhile reduce stormwater volumes discharging to sewer systems by the tank storage. The methodology and a RWH tank system was evaluated applying the daily rainfall data obtained in two met-stations of Blindern in Oslo and Rygge in Fredrikstad, South Norway. Results show, for all the considered scenarios in the two case studies that the use of the rainwater storage tank can provide significant reduction of water volume discharges to the storm water sewer, accordingly the resulting damages during the extreme events will be reduced.

Predictions for 2025 are that 70% of the world's population will be urban. Urban dwellers in particular, then, will need to adapt to climate change. Urbanization occurs at a rapid pace in secondary cities across Africa. Indeed, half the increase of urban populations in the coming years is expected to occur in secondary cities. Poor settlements near water bodies (rivers, irrigation systems and large dams) are prone to flooding, which is likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Employing an ecohealth approach, this study explores the vulnerabilities and resilience of poor urban settlers in four secondary cities of West Africa, all located in close proximity to water bodies: Korhogo, Cote d'Ivoire (212,000 inhabitants, near a dam); Kaedi, Mauritania (71,000 inhabitants, near a river); Ziguinchor, Senegal (269,000 inhabitants, near a river); and Kara, Togo (120,000 inhabitants, near a river). The aim of this study is to reinforce the resilience of the most vulnerable of these communities and their capacity to adapt to processes of drought and flooding in two climatic contexts: semi-arid and tropical humid. Local governance authorities play a central role in this project, which emphasizes participatory research, and explores linkages between hazards, vulnerabilities and local adaptive capacity potentials, particularly in the water and health sectors.

In order to adopt a different approach, considering not only building and infrastructure vulnerability and according to the goal of managing seismic risk reducing urban vulnerability, it is strategic to identify in peace time (before disastrous events) which elements, which activities, which functions of a city have prior importance after the event, to guarantee a rapid response and the reestablishment of normal conditions: this means identifying the resilient city. This study aims to define a methodological approach to identify the resilient city, adopting spatial multicriteria techniques and establishing resilient system identification considering functional, social, morphological, geological and dimensional characteristics of the considered urban system. In particular, some tests, considering a first set of criteria including accessibility, closeness to urban centres and main facilities, closeness to hydrographical networks, slope, map of seismic hazard, areas at high hydro-geological risk and seismic vulnerability of buildings, have been carried out on a town in Basilicata Region (southern Italy), mainly composed of an old part located on a hilltop, a modern part in the valley and a lot of rural settlements.

We examine a promising new tool for promoting this linkage-the metaphor of "cities of resilience." To put this tool to best use, we indicate how metaphor fits with other conceptual tools in science. We then present the two opposing definitions of resilience from ecology, and give reasons why one is more appropriate for linking with design. Additional specific tools and insights that are emerging from, or being increasingly used in, ecology can further support the linkage with urban design. These include recognizing the role of spatial heterogeneity in both ecological and social functioning of urban areas, the integrating power of watersheds, social and ecological patch dynamics of cities, the utility of spatial mosaic models to capture function, the use of an integrated "human ecosystem" modeling framework, and the consequent perspective of metropolitan areas as integrated ecological-social systems. Three additional tools are related to the adaptability of people and human institutions. First is the recognition of a "learning loop" in metropolitan ecosystems in which people respond to and affect ecological change, the use of urban design as experiments whose ecological and social outcomes can be measured, and finally the potency of a dialog between professionals and citizens, communities, and institutions, to support both research and design. The metaphor of resilience, and its technical specifications, draw these diverse strands for linking ecology and planning together. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Resilience to flooding: lessons from international comparison	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-URBAN DESIGN AND PLANNING			English	Article						floods & floodworks; government; social impact		Urban resilience is a key focus of current approaches to flood management. The notion of resilience encompasses pre-disaster planning and warning systems, emergency handling procedures and post-disaster reconstruction. Both human and physical systems are involved at all stages. The success of resilience programmes relies on the cooperation of floodplain populations-for example, increasing the installation of structural flood-resistant and resilient features requires significant commitment from property owners. Knowledge of common features of floodplain populations can therefore aid understanding of the ways in which such cooperation can be achieved. A review of international literature relating to flood proofing of homes and the attitudes of floodplain residents reveals that there are many barriers to overcome in encouraging the installation of resilient measures. Many of these barriers are common across surveyed populations: any proposed scheme must contend with informational barriers, emotional constraints, aesthetic considerations and timing issues. Other barriers depend on local circumstances, finance and regulatory regimes. Lessons can be learned from successful schemes that have overcome some or all of these problems if care is exercised in interpreting the scheme benefits in relation to the identified barriers.

Cities are responsible for the largest component of global energy, water, and food consumption as well as related sewage and organic waste production. Due to ongoing global urbanization, in which the largest sector of the global population lives in cities which are already built, global level strategies need to be developed that facilitate both the sustainable construction of new cities and the re-development of existing urban environments. A very promising approach in this regard is the decentralization and building integration of environmentally sound infrastructure systems for integrated resource management. This paper discusses such new and innovative building services engineering systems, which could contribute to increased energy efficiency, resource productivity, and urban resilience. Applied research and development projects in Germany, which are based on integrated system approaches for the integrated and environmentally sound management of energy, water and organic waste, are used as examples. The findings are especially promising and can be used to stimulate further research and development, including economical aspects which are crucial for sustainable urban (re-)development.

J	Gleeson, B				Gleeson, Brendan			Critical Commentary. Waking from the Dream: An Australian Perspective on Urban Resilience	URBAN STUDIES			English	Article								Climate change and energy insecurity are grave threats to the stability and sustainability of human society. This paper considers the meaning of this globally manifest, yet regionally differentiated, ecological threat for Australia's urban system. It also considers the twin ecological peril of oil depletion, whose impacts may intensify to great effect the social stresses likely to emerge as climates warm. The paper intervenes in the debate that transfixes contemporary Australian urbanism: the sustainability of the suburban form in which most Australians live. A similar if not identical debate exists in North America and parts of western Europe. These discussions may be overemphasising the environmental significance of urban form and failing to apprehend the deeper socio-cultural forces that drive the (over) consumption of nature. Planning thought and practice need to loosen the grip of physical determinism on their environmental comprehension if they are to comprehend accurately the sources of, and solutions to, ecological threat. New urban scientific evidence suggests that planning's principal role in the fight against warming will be one of adaptation not mitigation. That is to say, there is no simple 'spatial fix' for overconsumption.

As a consequence, city authorities are increasingly facing the challenge of finding ways to include adaptation strategies into their work, although related knowledge and competence is still scarce and fragmented. With the aim to contribute to knowledge development and organizational learning, the objective of this paper is to critically review and compare current theoretical and practical approaches to adaptation planning in cities. In order to do so, first the conceptual characteristics and features of a climate resilient city are identified. Second, the reciprocal linkages between climate-related disasters, urban form and city planning processes are analysed by considering the life cycle of disasters from causes, to short- and long-term impacts, to post-disaster response and recovery. Finally, urban adaptation measures proposed for both developed and so-called developing countries are assessed. On the basis of the identified differences, gaps and synergies between the theoretical and practical approaches to adaptation planning, the implications for improving sustainable urban transformation are discussed.

A scenario-based analysis of building energy performance	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-URBAN DESIGN AND PLANNING			English	Article						design methods & aids; energy conservation; urban regeneration		Inherent to the sustainability discourse is concern about the long-term future. If sustainable, cities must deliver positive benefits over their possibly long lifetime. Yet in formulating guidance and negotiating design choices for urban development, the consideration of uncertainty and potential future adverse conditions leading to failure is difficult to deal with. In this paper an approach to this issue that can inform the planning and/or urban design process is presented. It is based on a scenario analysis methodology (futures analysis), which herein is used to appraise the energy-efficiency strategies currently recommended in the UK planning system and best practice. The built environment is one of the major consumers of energy, and its energy efficiency is thereby central to any attempt to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Through the analysis, some important factors that could undermine good energy performance emerge. Such findings can lead to the making of decisions that can enhance urban resilience. The first part of the paper provides an overview of the energy-efficient strategies examined, as well as current approaches for considering the evolution of present conditions when planning. The second part presents the futures analysis and its significance is demonstrated through a case study.

Urban form, the spatial distribution of activities and urban organization are crucial aspects of cities' sustainability. Many tools and assessment systems have been developed to improve cities' energy efficiency and environmental footprint. However, most of these tools are based on the building scale. Most urban stakeholders are now convinced that a building scale approach is not sufficient: the scale of analysis should evolve from the building to the neighbourhood, district and city scales. An innovative system of indicators is presented that answers the need for multi-scale and cross-scale indicators and encompasses the intrinsic complexity of the city. Based on a morphologic approach, new mathematical formulas are used to generate urban sustainability indicators. These indicators can assist with the comparison of urban projects by using a structural point of view to assess the energy efficiency, social and environmental consequences of different urban forms. A comprehensive table displays 60 indicators and methods to quantify them. Some of these indicators have been quantified for real cities and are presented.

More in details, it will focus on the configurational approach to the analysis of urban settlements, briefly presenting the different methods and techniques it has inspired, sketching their features, highlighting their actual utility and their respective advantages and limits. Moreover, it will propose the use of some further configurational parameters, suitable for describing and reproducing interesting features of urban settlements; more in details, it will cast attention onto the richness and the variety of paths within a settlement, what makes it resilient, that is capable of sustaining changes and transformations without radically modifying its inner geography. Such parameters have been tested on the case studies of Pisa and Venice, which can easily be recognised as particularly relevant and significant, in that the results they provide are diametrically different. Those outputs will then be presented and discussed; the findings are suitable for suggesting resilience as a singular clue for urban orientation, so that the configurational techniques can be proposed as a tool for evaluating and predicting this spatial attitude, here finding an Ariadne's thread for urban wayfinding.

This has become central to the exploration of methods for achieving truly sustainable urban growth. However, while transitioning and resilience are useful descriptors, they can be abstract or conflicting ideals and their meanings obscured by a lack of concrete examples, both being barriers to many planning objectives. In this paper, we hold a lens over key issues in transitioning to resilience in urban areas by outlining emerging challenges that may offer directions towards operationalising how cities might transition to a more resilient future, while ensuring that communities are at the center of the process. The emerging and challenging areas - geospatial ICI, green infrastructure planning, novel design using collaborative responses, climate planning, limiting urban sprawl and short-circuit economic approaches - are explored as viable facets for devising and sustaining urban transition strategies. We conclude with a discussion on the need for developing a synergistic approach in practice to facilitate transition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ahern, J				Ahern, Jack			From <i>fail-safe</i> to <i>safe-to-fail</i>: Sustainability and resilience in the new urban world	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Non-equilibrium; Sustainability; Resilience; Adaptive planning and design	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY; SCIENCE	The extent to which the 21st century world will be "sustainable" depends in large part on the sustainability of cities. Early ideas on implementing sustainability focused on concepts of achieving stability, practicing effective management and the control of change and growth - a "fail-safe" mentality. More recent thinking about change, disturbance, uncertainty, and adaptability is fundamental to the emerging science of resilience, the capacity of systems to reorganize and recover from change and disturbance without changing to other states - in other words, systems that are "safe to fail." While the concept of resilience is intellectually intriguing, it remains largely unpracticed in contemporary urban planning and design. This essay discusses the theory of resilience as it applies to urban conditions, and offers a suite of strategies intended to build urban resilience capacity: multifunctionality, redundancy and modularization, (bio and social) diversity, multi-scale networks and connectivity, and adaptive planning and design. The strategies are discussed in the context of resilience theory and sustainability science, and are illustrated with innovative policies, projects, and programs selected from international examples.

J	Romero-Lankao, P; Gnatz, DM				Romero-Lankao, Patricia; Gnatz, Daniel M.			Exploring urban transformations in Latin America	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review							SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; MULTILEVEL PERSPECTIVE; WATER MANAGEMENT; RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; CITIES; EVOLUTIONARY; ADAPTATION; FRAMEWORK; INSIGHTS	The question of how to transform behaviors, systems, cultures and institutions to move to more sustainable and resilient cities has received increased attention among scholars and decision makers. However, while sustainability and resilience are increasingly becoming core issues for different strands of scholarship, the strategies for affecting change toward more sustainable and resilient urban centers remain elusive. We use a combination of elements from socio-technical transition theory and political ecology and two Latin American cities (Mexico City and Manizales) to suggest a framework for an analysis of urban transitions in Latin America. The two cities were faced with similar triggers and pressures to create sustainability and resilience and each acted within a time of sweeping international movements. In both cases, networks of actors introduced innovative responses to their own particular set of pressures, constraints and opportunities and attempted to expand nature's life-supporting features such as ecosystem and hydrological services, while reducing threats from hazards such as floods. Yet the innovations that took place in the two cities presented very different results with regard to regime transition. Interestingly, Mexico City's success at creating an urban regime change seems to have been based on the use of a top-down approach as it was driven mainly by actors within the existing power structure with access to the power and the resources of an authoritarian state. By contrast, actors in Manizales have been largely outside the power structure and had less success in creating a city-wide transformation. This highlights the importance of power structure dynamics that can promote or prevent transformations from within or impede transformations from without.

Neighbourhood or 'place' is an important factor in deciding social and economic outcomes. Neighbourhood is also increasingly important for urban planning across Europe as communities are at the front-line in developing resilience to anthropogenic and natural shocks. The current financial crisis and public sector austerity measures across Europe represent shocks to local communities that require policymakers to maximize investments and resources delivered to local communities. Communities and citizens can therefore play a bigger role in contributing to the resilience of cities through local neighbourhood planning. However, there is a need to work differently as public and private finances are restricted and communities need to co-produce plans and delivery of services. Co-production can therefore be one contribution to solutions designed to foster resilience and deliver efficient neighbourhood planning and associated services. Co-production in this context requires an open source approach in which producers and consumers can observe viewpoints and react to the implications of simulated outcomes. Whilst there are numerous examples of Planning Support Systems (PSS) designed to assist urban planners there has been no significant progress made in developing a 'grounded' approach incorporating 'real-time' inputs from users and stakeholders at the neighbourhood level. This paper sets out the principles and objectives of a simulation-based OpenPlan system in which producers and consumers swap roles. This leads to a greater co-production of planning inputs designed to deliver optimal outcomes and more resilient cities.

J	Nirupama, N; Maula, A				Nirupama, N.; Maula, Amanda			Engaging public for building resilient communities to reduce disaster impact	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Community resilience; Community participation; Disaster; Vulnerability; Risk perception		Perception about people's behaviour during emergencies defines, to a large extent, the course of planning and resource allocation for community emergency response as well as development of mitigation measures. During the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in the approach to disaster management. A recent trend has been to encourage more community participation as opposed to the top-down approach of the past. It is believed that community participation will bring about a comprehensive and accurate appreciation of people's perception regarding hazards, risk, vulnerability, and resilience, and this research is an attempt to achieve just that. In order to accomplish our goal, we engaged a group of women that would typically fall into the category of "vulnerable group" in a focus group interview setting. The participants were mainly over 40 years old, the majority with little education, unemployed, facing language barriers, of low income, and reliant on public transit. Many participants identified that they lived in the vicinity of rivers, lakes, railways, or power plants, but did not seem to be aware of their exposure to potential threats-indicating a lack of education and awareness. The most common hazards and mitigation measures they were aware of, included floods (including basement flooding), fire, fire alarm, and smoke detectors. Additionally, illness and loneliness were mentioned as factors contributing to their increased vulnerability, hence reduced resiliency. With the help of the focus group members' participation, we were able to discuss the importance of communities being aware of their surroundings, available resources and help, and permit them to voice their concerns in order to be able to cope during emergencies. We trust and hope that more community participation will lead to stronger and more resilient cities.

Forests and trees for social adaptation to climate variability and change	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Review							ECOSYSTEM-BASED ADAPTATION; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; TROPICAL FORESTS; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; MANGROVE RESTORATION; COASTAL VEGETATION; NATURAL INSURANCE; COPING STRATEGIES; 2004 TSUNAMI	Ecosystems provide important services that can help people adapt to climate variability and change. Recognizing this role of ecosystems, several international and nongovernmental organizations have promoted an ecosystem-based approach to adaptation. We review the scientific literature related to ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) with forests and trees, and highlight five cases in which forests and trees can support adaptation: (1) forests and trees providing goods to local communities facing climatic threats; (2) trees in agricultural fields regulating water, soil, and microclimate for more resilient production; (3) forested watersheds regulating water and protecting soils for reduced climate impacts; (4) forests protecting coastal areas from climate-related threats; and (5) urban forests and trees regulating temperature and water for resilient cities. The literature provides evidence that EBA with forests and trees can reduce social vulnerability to climate hazards; however, uncertainties and knowledge gaps remain, particularly for regulating services in watersheds and coastal areas. Few studies have been undertaken on EBA specifically, but the abundant literature on ecosystem services can be used to fill knowledge gaps. Many studies assess the multiple benefits of ecosystems for human adaptation or well-being, but also recognize trade-offs between ecosystem services. Better understanding is needed of the efficiency, costs, and benefits, and trade-offs of EBA with forests and trees. Pilot projects under implementation could serve as learning sites and existing information could be systematized and revisited with a climate change adaptation lens.

J	Muller, M				Muller, Mike			Adapting to climate change: water management for urban resilience	ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION			English	Article						adaptation; aid effectiveness; climate change; dams; hydrology; sub-Saharan Africa; water		Global warming and related climate changes are likely to significantly increase the weather-related risks facing human settlements, including floods, water and power supply failures and associated economic collapse into "failed cities". Action to help poor urban communities adapt to become more resilient to possible change must therefore be initiated, although to date attention has focused on mitigation rather than adaptation. This paper considers the physical and financial implications for urban areas of the potential impacts of climate variability and change on water resources, illustrated by examples from sub-Saharan Africa, which is likely to be one of the most vulnerable and most affected regions. Water management, which will be particularly affected by climate change, could provide an opportunity to initiate structured adaptation responses. Adaptation costs in the sub-Saharan urban water sector are estimated at between 10 and 20 per cent of current overseas development assistance to the region. This paper suggests that additional funding should be made available in terms of the "polluter pays" principle, and should be channelled through government budgets rather than ring-fenced climate funds. This would help ensure that "climate proofing" is mainstreamed and would be in keeping with current trends in overseas development assistance reflected in the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

In view of its potential to regulate urban climates, green infrastructure will assume a critical role in these strategies. In addition to their positive microclimatic effects, as a source of cooling in dense, hot cities urban green spaces can contribute to mitigation. They can operate as carbon sinks or can reduce energy consumption for air conditioning by providing shade by urban trees or roof-top greenery. Thus, urban green spaces should be incorporated as a significant component into both adaptation and mitigation strategies. This paper focuses on the potentials and constraints of various types and structures of urban green spaces and vegetation in influencing climatic conditions in urban areas. It examines the ability of urban green spaces to counter the urban heat island effect and other impacts of climate change. The scientific findings discussed are based on urban vegetation analysis and climate modelling as well as analysis of planning approaches and instruments in German cities. They will be analysed in the context of the future relevance of greens spaces, and within the framework of current urban planning and development mechanisms.

Climate change is increasing the pressures on many urban systems and adding to this complexity. Many of the case studies investigating urban dynamics in the light of climate change have chosen narrow, sector-specific approaches. Few projects have built on insights from complexity theory and related bodies of knowledge which are more consistent with the perspective that urban infrastructure systems are tightly coupled with one another and must respond to often subtle, long-term changes of technological, social and environmental conditions. Drawing on that knowledge, and building on insights from previous case studies, this article explores the potential roles of complexity theory in guiding investment and policy decisions in the urban context. Policy and management that are consistent with insights from complexity theory will need to anticipate a wide array of potential trajectories for urban dynamics, identify and implement strategies that are robust under a range of potential developments, continuously innovate the policy-making and management institutions, and intensify the exchange of knowledge between science and society.

J	McEvoy, D; Ahmed, I; Mullett, J				McEvoy, Darryn; Ahmed, Iftekhar; Mullett, Jane			The impact of the 2009 heat wave on Melbourne's critical infrastructure	LOCAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						climate impacts; heat wave; infrastructure; urban system; adaptation		The impact of the extreme heat wave that affected Melbourne, Australia, in two distinct phases in January and February 2009 was severe, with 374 (heat) and 173 (bushfire) excess deaths. Whilst the human health issues have been covered in detail in policy and academic arenas, much less attention has been paid to the adverse impacts on urban infrastructure. Analysis of this event, underpinned by participatory actor-based research, has shown that the impacts were experienced disproportionately across different infrastructure types. For water, telecommunications and airports, the impacts were relatively minor and the impact on rail transport and roads (and to a lesser extent, seaports) was of moderate significance, whereas research findings indicate that the electricity sector was found to be the most vulnerable. This paper focuses on the sectors that were worst impacted: electricity, rail and road transport. Commentary identifies the direct and indirect impacts of the heat event, including associated cascading effects, as well as considering actual and potential adaptation responses both before and after the event. Concluding, the authors reflect on the implications of the heat wave for urban resilience, emphasising the crucial importance of understanding the urban environment as a complex and interconnected system.

Damage estimation of subterranean building constructions due to groundwater inundation - the GIS-based model approach GRUWAD	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT	The analysis and management of flood risk commonly focuses on surface water floods, because these types are often associated with high economic losses due to damage to buildings and settlements. The rising groundwater as a secondary effect of these floods induces additional damage, particularly in the basements of buildings. Mostly, these losses remain underestimated, because they are difficult to assess, especially for the entire building stock of flood-prone urban areas. For this purpose an appropriate methodology has been developed and lead to a groundwater damage simulation model named GRUWAD. The overall methodology combines various engineering and geoinformatic methods to calculate major damage processes by high groundwater levels. It considers a classification of buildings by building types, synthetic depth-damage functions for groundwater inundation as well as the results of a groundwater-flow model. The modular structure of this procedure can be adapted in the level of detail. Hence, the model allows damage calculations from the local to the regional scale. Among others it can be used to prepare risk maps, for ex-ante analysis of future risks, and to simulate the effects of mitigation measures. Therefore, the model is a multifarious tool for determining urban resilience with respect to high groundwater levels.

J	Macmillan, H				Macmillan, Hugh			Mining, housing and welfare in South Africa and Zambia: an historical perspective	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article						mineworkers; housing; welfare; gold; copper; platinum		This contribution seeks to place the relationship between mining, housing and welfare in historical perspective in two Southern African countries with long histories of mining activity that continue to have large mining sectors, namely South Africa and Zambia. Mining capitalists and colonial, as well as apartheid, governments tended to resist urban permanence, but they were usually unable to stop it. Economists and social anthropologists, being less conscious than historians of the cyclical nature of mining, have been prone to discount the remarkable tenacity of the Zambian Copperbelt's urban residents in the face of mining downturns. By contrast, very little attention in the literature has been paid to the decline of gold mining in South Africa. In view of the Zambian precedent for urban resilience, it would be unwise to overlook the continuing influence of South African mining on urban settlement in spite of the industry's gradual decline over the last four decades. The patterns of development of new platinum mines in South Africa and new copper mines in Zambia show certain similarities and historical continuities, including a reluctance on the part of mining companies to accept responsibility for the housing and welfare of all their workers and their families.

It also has a rapidly rising population with significant growth expected into the future. This paper analyses Australia's existing infrastructure and urban form, the carbon implications associated with it, along with the resources needed to sustain this way of life. The paper demonstrates how the current design of Australian cities based on large houses in low density, dispersed suburbs, which are highly car dependent is extremely resource and emission intensive and ultimately unsustainable. It is argued that the large scale, centralised management of resources, based on outdated technologies and compounded by aging infrastructure further exacerbates the problem. If Australia continues under this 'business as usual' scenario, an increase in emissions, along with numerous resource concerns can be expected. The authors contend, therefore, that Australia urgently needs to transform its cities to embrace new low carbon designs and more efficient and resilient urban systems and processes to ensure the long-term viability of Australian cities. A new model for cities is thus proposed, which is based around the concept of decentralized management of resources using new, low carbon technologies that appear to function best at the precinct level. These can help to create more integrated and resilient infrastructure systems within our cities that will greatly improve efficiency. The technologies outlined, however, are dependent on the urban form in that they are only effective and economically viable if sufficient density exists. In the case of Australian cities, this would therefore involve increasing the density in many areas, especially new centres. Adding density has numerous other benefits such as enabling better public transport infrastructure, which will reduce car dependency and the related transported emissions. Using density to transform cities can also improve quality of life by offering more local amenities and better lifestyles.

J	McDonnell, MJ; Hahs, AK				McDonnell, Mark J.; Hahs, Amy K.			The future of urban biodiversity research: Moving beyond the 'low-hanging fruit'	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article							URBANIZATION; ECOLOGY; GRADIENT; CONSERVATION; PREDATION; BIOLOGY; TRAITS; GROWTH	In this era of rapidly urbanising human populations, urban practitioners are under increasing pressure to create resilient and sustainable cities and towns. Urban ecologists currently have a unique opportunity to apply solid, evidence-based research to help create biodiversity-rich and sustainable cities and towns for the future. Unfortunately, there is currently a mismatch between the questions planners, designers and decision-makers are asking urban ecologists that would allow them to improve the biodiversity outcomes in urban areas, and the questions urban ecologists must ask to contribute to the development and application of the science of urban ecology. For a number of reasons, urban ecologists over the past 25 years have primarily focused on describing the patterns of biodiversity in cities and towns using broad, aggregate predictor variables (e.g., distance to city center, land-use, percent cover of impermeable surfaces and vegetation, etc.). We refer to these results as 'low-hanging fruit'. If the discipline of urban ecology is going to provide the necessary information to inform actions to preserve and enhance urban biodiversity, we need to move beyond place-based research, and work towards the development of confirmed generalizations regarding the relationship between the structure and function of urban ecosystems and biodiversity. We propose three essential strategies for achieving this refined understanding: 1) defining the study window to place the study into a broader global context, 2) collecting and using more explicit question-driven measures of the urban condition in order to improve our understanding of urban ecological drivers, as well as recording more detailed ecological responses to provide insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying an observed response, and 3) expanding studies to include multiple cities, regions and countries. These strategies will help to expedite the ability of urban ecology to contribute to the creation of biodiversity-rich, healthy, resilient cities and towns.

Operationalising a resilience approach to adapting an urban delta to uncertain climate changes	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE			English	Article						Resilience; Resilience principles; Climate change adaptation; Uncertainty; Urban planning	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS	Climate change may pose considerable challenges to coastal cities, particularly in low-lying urban deltas. Impacts are, however, associated with substantial uncertainties. This paper studies an uncertainty-robust adaptation strategy: strengthening the resilience of the impacted system. This approach is operationalised for the city of Rotterdam, using literature study, interviews, and a workshop. Potential impacts have been explored using national climate statistics and scenarios and a set of 'wildcards' (imaginable surprises). Sea level rise, particularly in combination with storm surge, and enduring heat and drought are the most relevant potential stresses in the area. These can lead to damage, loss of image, and societal disruption. Unclear responsibilities enhance disruption. 'Resilience principles' nude the concept of resilience sufficiently operational for local actors to explore policy options. Useful principles for urban resilience include: homeostasis, omnivory, high flux, flatness, buffering, redundancy, foresight and preparedness/planning, compartmentalisation, and flexible planning/design. A resilience approach makes the system less prone to disturbances, enables quick and flexible responses, and is better capable of dealing with surprises than traditional predictive approaches. Local actors frame resilience as a flexible approach to adaptation that would be more suitable and tailored to local situations than rigid top-down regulations. In addition to a change in policy, it would require a more pro-active mentality among the population. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Wardekker, J.

THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES' MANAGEMENT IN URBAN REGENERATION AND RESILIENCE IMPROVEMENT	MANAGEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, BOOK 2			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Management of Technological Changes	SEP 01-03, 2011	Alexandroupolis, GREECE	Democritus Univ Thrace, Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ, Central & E European Management Dev Assoc, Ctr Continu Educ & Train, Region E Macedonia & Thrace				This main objective of this paper is to present the actual needs in urban regeneration and in improving their resilience and to enhance the role of managing properly the technological changes in sustainable development of towns and cities. Our studies are based on the principles actions sustained by European Union with respect to urban regeneration. Also, this paper will continue our researches regarding peripherality and urban sustainable development by introducing in our work new key elements from Urban Chart of cities. The paper will be based on researches about management of technological changes in urban areas, study, cases and comparative studies between different types of urban regeneration. The results of this paper will be based on a set of recommendations which will can lately be the base of a usefull guideline for regional and local authorities in their effort to improve the urban resilience and to sustain the process of regeneration. Romanian cities continue to face problems regarding infrastructure degradation, a low quality of live and a poor environment quality. We intend through this paper to emphasize this new concept which, by promoting the important role of technological changes and the efficient mnagement of technological changes in urban areas, will corelate aspects of urban sustainable development with principles of urban regeneration. This paper will underline the link between sustainable development and cities management with the role of implementing an integrated approach of urban economical, social and spatial problems. The management of technological changes play an important role in this process through its added value.	[Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir, R.; Costescu, I.

It is likely to bring severe consequences for human life and settlements. Until recently, climate policy focused on mitigation actions, which aim to curb global warming and avoid further climate change. However, the increasing evidences that world's climate is actually changing have led to increase of attention on adaptation actions along with the mitigation ones. Thus, it is now widely recognized that prompt mitigation and adaptation actions are required to tackle the climate problem. Cities can play crucial roles in tackling climate change by means of mitigation and adaptation actions. Firstly, cities contribute much to the causes of climate change in terms of GHG emissions and land use change. Secondly, cities accommodate more than half of the world's population and critical economic activities. Climate change-related events will disturb the lives of a large part of the population and key economic activities. On the other hand, cities can be an essential part of the solution. Inherent advantages of cities like concentration of people, enterprises and infrastructure, are, in fact, opportunities to formulate effective and low-cost solutions. Citywide actions are believed to entail significant potential to address the climate problem. Despite its importance, urban context has still not been adequately addressed in climate change debate. Although the literature on climate change issues in urban context is emerging, a range of policy responses in terms of tangible mitigation and adaptation actions have been developed in many cities. Yet a systematic understanding of these policy responses is missing. This paper aims to point to this gap and contribute to the emerging literature on climate change issues in urban context. Based on review of major works in the field, the paper first provides an overview of most important impacts of climate change on cities, and then discusses the policy responses, which are necessary for transition from today's carbon-emitter and vulnerable cities to future's low-carbon and resilient cities.

The cycle produces simultaneous hot and cold streams at three temperature levels; 60 degrees C for hot water, 40 degrees C for low temperature ambient heating, 10 degrees C for ambient cooling. The cycle has been designed to fulfil the requirements of a flexible 'hybrid' trigeneration scheme, where the three energy streams (electricity, heating and cooling) can be matched closely to the user demands - maximising the Energy Utilisation Factor (EUF) of the fuel. Such a system is likely to be used in environmentally resilient cities in either tertiary sector buildings, interconnected residential zones, industry or other large buildings such as hospitals and educational establishments. The cycle is activated using recuperated thermal energy from a gas turbine exhaust stream and under certain operating conditions uses a small proportion of the electricity produced by the gas turbine generator set. Recuperation is achieved using a direct exhaust gas to R744 recuperating heat exchanger. At higher levels of thermal recuperation, the increase in expander inlet temperature results in a substantial increase in the Coefficient Of Performance (COP). With an expander inlet temperature of 250 degrees C the cycle achieves a COP in cooling of 1.13, whilst with a expander inlet temperature of 350 degrees C the cycle achieves a COP in cooling of 1.58. These values of COP in cooling are typical of double and triple stage absorption chillers respectively. The values for COP in heating are 1.97 for an expander inlet temperature of 250 degrees C, and 2.41 for an expander inlet temperature of 350 degrees C. The cycle is also capable of acting as a power positive bottoming cycle, whilst still providing heating and cooling. Under these circumstances, and assuming an expander inlet temperature of 350 degrees C, the cycle has a thermal to mechanical conversion efficiency of 9.7%. The corresponding values of COP in cooling and heating are 1.03 and 1.80 respectively.

Three Points Approach (3PA) for urban flood risk management: A tool to support climate change adaptation through transdisciplinarity and multifunctionality	URBAN WATER JOURNAL			English	Article						complexity; decision making; resilience; spatial planning; process management; water aspects; social values	DRAINAGE; VULNERABILITY; SYSTEM; 21ST-CENTURY; HAZARD	Urban flood risk is increasing as a consequence of climate change and growing impervious surfaces. Increasing complexity of the urban context, gradual loss of tacit knowledge and decreasing social awareness are at the same time leading to inadequate choices with respect to urban flood risk management (UFRM). The European Flood Risk Directive emphasises the need for non-structural measures aimed at urban resilience and social preparedness. The Three Points Approach (3PA) provides a structure facilitating the decision making processes dealing with UFRM. It helps to accept the complexity of the urban context and promotes transdisciplinarity and multifunctionality. The 3PA introduces three domains wherein water professionals may act and where aspects valued by different stakeholders come into play: (1) technical optimisation, dealing with standards and guidelines for urban drainage systems; (2) spatial planning, making the urban area more resilient to future changing conditions; and (3) day-to-day values, enhancing awareness, acceptance and participation among stakeholders. Based on in-depth interviews conducted in The Netherlands and Denmark, we describe the complexity of decision making in practical UFRM and explain how the 3PA can be used when organising participatory processes. We introduce a theoretical framework characterising the large range of aspects involved in decision making related to UFRM and evaluate the usefulness of the 3PA in dealing with it. We conclude that the 3PA offers water managers and operators an efficient communication tool and thinking system, which helps to reduce complexity to a level suitable when organising strategy plans for UFRM and urban adaptation to climate change.

Among the population groups affected by disaster, children are particularly vulnerable. Responsible disaster intervention requires both top-down and bottom-up preparation that endorses an ecological perspective, taking into consideration the impact upon individuals and families as well as on neighborhoods and entire communities. In such an approach, preventive and post-disaster interventions with children should be integrated with community leadership, local schools, welfare units, social institutions and medical centers. In this paper we briefly summarize how disaster affects children and their protective matrix. We further discuss the concept of personal and community resilience, its definitions and components. The worldview of this system-oriented approach encompasses perceptions of public health and administration, community capital and resilience and preventive education. We describe what makes a community a resilient one, and the role played by preparedness. Finally, we describe the Cohen-Harris Model of Urban Resilience, its rationale, and its four resilience programs (health/mental health, population, information and school resilience).In this model, the local authority serves as the command center for emergency preparedness and resilience is developed through everyday activities that are an integral part of the urban routine. This model relies on interest in child welfare to enlist leaders, institutions and communities to act as well to motivate the entire community and to implement far-reaching and systemic changes. Interest in all aspects of children's lives serves to integrate the actions of families, organizations and communities.

The structural difference between a tree and a leaf is huge: one is open, the other closed. Trees are entirely disconnected on a given scale: even if two twigs are spatially close, if they do not belong to the same branch, to go from one to the other implies moving down and then up all the hierarchy of branches. Leaves on the contrary are entirely connected on intermediary scales. The veins of a leaf are disconnected on the two larger scales but entirely connected on the two or three following intermediary scales before presenting tiny tree-like structures on the finest capillary scales. Urban system's structural resilience is highest when it is configured according to a scale free structure for its parts and for its connections. The spatial distribution and the intensity of connections in such a structure obeys a scale-free distribution. It states the frequency of an element's appearance and the span of a connection based on its hierarchic level: the smaller an element is, the more often it will be encountered in the system; the bigger an element is the rarer it will be. This fundamental law defines in itself the manner in which living organisms and things should be organized to optimize their access to energy, the use that they make of it, and their resilience. The history of urban planning has evolved from leaf-like to tree-like patterns, with a consequent loss of efficiency and resilience.

The role of public space for risk mitigation and urban redevelopment and the role of environmental disasters for reassessing the 'space of the Public'	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF PLANNING PRACTICE			English	Article								This paper stems from long-lasting research dedicated to urban risk reduction through a planning approach. It focuses on public space, proposing an inversion of the usual perspective: instead of considering public spaces for risk mitigation and urban redevelopment, here the imperatives of environmental safety and urban resilience can be instrumental for exploring the meaning and role of the public space from a different, rather compelling point of view. instrumental for exploring the meaning and role of the public space from a different, rather compelling point of view. One starting point is the concept of SUM, Strategic Urban Structure (or Framework), from the Italian "Struttura urbana minima", which has been introduced in order to set out the contents of urban risk reduction in local administration agendas and particularly into ordinary planning processes. The SUM has been conceived both as an analytical and a normative/planning tool. Public spaces are the backbone of both urban structure and of the SUM. From their features, localization, distribution within the settlement, and their systemic characters, largely depend the capacity of a town to positively react to a seismic event. Six case-studies of small and medium-size historic towns in the Umbria Region (one of the many Italian Regions with a high level of seismic risk), help to understand the complexities and problems related to seismic prevention within historical centres, and the conflicts between conservation of the heritage and the imperatives of environmental safety. In order to overcome possible criticalities identified in a SUM, it is necessary to provide alternatives to its functioning through redundant elements. The concept of redundancy, which is strictly related to that of uncertainty, is very interesting and promising in this field of research.

By environmental literature conducted recently, it has been evidently comprehended that urban life quality for mankind and others can be improved by serving these systems with green and living elements. This study is to investigate urban rocky habitats that have special natural characteristics and that can be implicated for urban green areas. But these habitats have been considered as nature splits withstanding against the urban pressures by means of the unplanned build-up activities foremost, and road construction, poor quality or neglected remnants. Therefore, this study presents the environmental perception and preferences of urban rocky habitats which are threatening within excessive urbanization and human use of natural areas in the context of the city of Trabzon, Turkey. So, a total of 20 habitats selected from urban and surroundings were Surveyed by using a questionnaire and landscape assessment approach. With Surveying performed on 204 participants, visual preferences, landscape attributes and proposed management options for urban nature conservation were determined. The chi(2)-test results revealed clearly that he demographic and expertise status of the participants were correlated with the preferences for types of rocky habitat scene and management options. The scenes with natural elements and less human disturbance obtained higher scores on visual preferences than any of the urban rocky scenes lacking these characteristics. Also, in the quantitative phase, factor analysis based on principal component structure revealed the 'visual and spatial effects', the 'usage and arrangement', the 'naturalness and ecological value', and the 'functionality' components of the scenes. Consequently, some implications for the effective and efficient planning and development Of urban nature conservation by assisting the letter understanding of he various patterns of landscape preference, choice and satisfaction in habitats under the present study were suggested.
