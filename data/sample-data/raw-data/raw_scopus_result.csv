Managing this risk requires effective climate adaptation policies - strategic courses of action designed to strengthen urban resilience to climate-related stress. City governments have a key role to play in adaptation policy design, but they appear to face challenges in marshalling political commitment and technical capacity. This article examines elements of urban climate adaptation policy targeting extreme weather and analyzes the policy development process in two major Canadian cities, Toronto and Halifax. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","","Alcoba N., Cut daycare, plant fewer trees for savings: reports, The National Post, (2011); Auld H., Maclver D., Changing weather patterns, uncertainty and infrastructure risks: Emerging adaptation requirements; Arisz H., Burrell B.C., Urban drainage infrastructure planning and design considering climate change, Proceedings of the Engineering Institute of Canada Climate Change Technology Conference, pp. 1-9; Birkland T.A., Natural disasters as focusing events: Policy communities and political response, International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, 14, 2, pp. 221-243, (1996); Birkland T.A., Lessons of Disaster: Policy Change After Catastrophic Events, (2006); Bohle H.G., Downing T.E., Watts M.J., Climate change and social vulnerability, Global Environmental Change, 4, 1, pp. 37-48, (1994); Bosher L., Dainty A., Carrillo P., Glass J., Built-in resilience to disasters: A pre-emptive approach, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management, 14, 5, pp. 434-446, (2007); Bowyer P., Hurricane Juan Storm Summary, (2003); Bruce J.P., Burton I., Egener I.D.M., Thelen J., Municipal Risk Assessment: Investigation of the Potential Municipal Impacts and Adaptation Measures Envisioned as a Result of Climate Change, (2002); Burby R.J., Deyle R.E., Godschalk D.R., Olshansky R.B., Creating hazard resilient communities through land-use planning, Natural Hazards Review, 1, 2, pp. 99-106, (2000); Burch S., In pursuit of resilient communities: An examination of barriers to climate change action in three Canadian cities, Energy Policy, 38, 12, pp. 7575-7585, (2009); Burton I., Adapt and thrive: Options for reducing the climate change adaptation deficit, Policy Options, 27, 1, pp. 33-38, (2005); Burton I., Huq S., Lim B., Pilifosova O., Schipper E.L., From impacts assessment to adaptation priorities: The shaping of adaptation policy, Climate Policy, 2, 2-3, pp. 145-159, (2002); Ontario storm costs $400 million, Canadian Underwriter, 72, 9, (2005); Carmin J., Zhang Y., Achieving urban climate adaptation in Europe and central Asia; Chang S.E., McDaniels T.L., Mikawoz J., Peterson K., Infrastructure failure interdependencies in extreme events, Natural Hazards, 41, 2, pp. 337-358, (2007); Christensen J.H., Hewitson B., Busuioc A., Chen A., Gao X., Held I., Jones R., Kolli R.K., Kwon W.-T., Laprise R., Magana R.V., Mearns L., Menendez C.G., Raisanen J., Rinke A., Sarr A., Whetton P., Regional climate projections, Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

Cities may be considered as resources reservoirs and producers of secondary resources. This paper introduces the concept of urban harvesting as a management tool to change inefficient linear urban resource usage and waste production into sustainable urban metabolism. The Urban Harvest concept includes urban metabolism and closing urban cycles by harvesting urban resources. The purpose of this study was to quantify the potentials to harvest water and energy at different scales. We investigated potentials for the Netherlands. Results show that at national scale, potentials can cover up to 100% of electricity demand, 55% of heat demand and 52% of tap water demand. At neighborhood level, similar percentages were found for energy. Only 43% of water demand was achieved, due to fact that treatment measures were not considered. These results indicate the large potential of cities as providers of their own resources. Therefore urban resources management is a key element of future city design towards more resilient cities. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This has resulted in an urgent need for a radical and large-scale eco-technological overhaul. This chapter focuses on the paradigm shift towards sustainability and resilience, and particularly, how the new thinking of resilience can convert investments in urban infrastructure and development into resilient support systems, enabling both greater city prosperity and environmental regeneration. The objectives of this chapter are to search for new paths in the creation of resilient communities through the sustainable use of technologies; to discuss the significance of equity, economy, and traditional knowledge in resilient cities; to put forward a green approach that encompasses both mitigation and adaptation; and to explore potential and practical ways of creating urban resilience. A detailed review of existing definitions and policies related to urban resilience, as well as the role of eco-technologies and city planners in this process, is also presented. The chapter concludes by suggesting a set of urban design strategies and a list of key stakeholders as critical ingredients in the move towards urban resilience. © 2014, IGI Global.","","","Barnett J., Adapting to climate change in Pacific Island communities., World Development, 29, pp. 977-993, (2001); Beatley T., Planning for coastal resilience, (2009); Berkes F., Folke C., Linking social and ecological systems: management practices and social mechanisms for building resilience, (1998); Bogunovich D., Eco-tech cities: Smart metabolism for a green urbanism., The sustainable city II, pp. 75-84, (2002); Bogunovich D., From planning sustainable cities to designing resilient urban regions, Sustainable development and planning IV, pp. 87-96, (2009); Chambers S., Minority empowerment and environmental justice., Urban Affairs Review, 43, 1, pp. 28-54, (2007); Coaffee J., Risk, resilience, and environmentally sustainable cities., Energy Policy, 36, pp. 4633-4638, (2008); Cowan C., Todorovic N., Spiral dynamics: The layers of human values in strategy., Strategy and Leadership, 28, 1, pp. 4-12, (2000); Ercoskun O.Y., Green urban planning and design for smarter communities., Organizational communication and sustainable development, pp. 41-59, (2010); Urban design for sustainability, (2004); Farr D., Sustainable urbanism: Urban design with nature, (2008); HAZUS: Methodology for estimating potential losses from disasters.; Folke C., Colding J., Berkes F., Synthesis: Building resilience and adaptive capacity in social-ecological systems., Navigating socialecological systems, pp. 352-387, (2003); Franne L., Hammarby Sjöstad- A unique environmental project in Stockholm, (2007); Frey H., Designing the city: Towards a more sustainable urban form, (1999); Gleeson B., Critical commentary.

The notion of urban resilience is not just confined to academic discourses - it is increasingly prevalent in urban policy documents. This paper examines awareness and understanding of urban resilience in the planning policy arena in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where planning has a long history of managing water. Specific attention in the paper is paid to the issue of climate change and how planning processes in the city consider or deal with the risks that it presents. The ways in which the city assesses and prepares for these risks or threats form the two main areas of analysis. The paper concludes that evidence of resilient thinking can be found at all levels of decision-making, ranging from the transnational to local levels. However, the notion of resilience is still quite fuzzy and its significance can vary substantially between policy officials and between policy documents, sometimes even within the same administration. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Resilience; Rotterdam; Spatial planning; The Netherlands; Water management","Netherlands; Rotterdam; South Holland; climate change; decision making; planning process; resilience; spatial planning; urban planning; urban policy; water management","Beatley T., Planning for coastal resilience, (2009); Bernhard M., Urban and regional resilience - A new catchword or a consistent concept for research and practice?

If prevention of nuclear terrorism fails, then reducing exposure to radioactive fallout is the intervention that can save the most lives following a nuclear detonation. Yet, most Americans are not familiar with correct safety measures against fallout, and many believe that nothing can be done to reduce the suffering and death inflicted by a nuclear attack. Moreover, cities have no checklist on how to prepare the emergency management infrastructure and the larger population for this hazard, despite hundreds of pages of useful guidance from the federal government and radiation professional organizations. The Rad Resilient City Checklist reverses this situation by converting the latest federal guidance and technical reports into clear, actionable steps for communities to take to protect their residents from exposure to radioactive fallout. The checklist reflects the shared judgment of the Nuclear Resilience Expert Advisory Group, a national panel led by the Center for Biosecurity and comprised of government decision makers, scientific experts, emergency responders, and leaders from business, volunteer, and community sectors. © 2013 Health Physics Society.","accidents; emergencies; emergency planning; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; nuclear; radiological","Checklist; Cities; Civil Defense; Expert Testimony; Nuclear Weapons; Radiation Protection; Radioactive Fallout; article; atomic bomb; checklist; city; civil defense; expert witness; radiation protection; radioactive waste","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84885442257"

With their high degree of interdependency, urban networks and services are critical issues for the resilience of a city. And yet, network managers are scarcely aware of their flaws and dependencies and they are reluctant to take them into account. In order to develop an operational tool to improve urban resilience, we propose here an auto-diagnosis method to be completed by network managers.

A dimensionless methodology developed based on a water balance model at daily temporal scale was applied to determine both the obtainable water saving due to the use of rain water for toilet flushing (i.e. reduce the use of portable water) and meanwhile reduce stormwater volumes discharging to sewer systems by the tank storage. The methodology and a RWH tank system was evaluated applying the daily rainfall data obtained in two met-stations of Blindern in Oslo and Rygge in Fredrikstad, South Norway. Results show, for all the considered scenarios in the two case studies that the use of the rainwater storage tank can provide significant reduction of water volume discharges to the storm water sewer, accordingly the resulting damages during the extreme events will be reduced. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Climate change; CSOs; Flooding; Rain water harvesting; Retention; Storage tank","Civil engineering; Combined sewers; Digital storage; Oil well flooding; Rain; Storms; Tanks (containers); Water conservation; Water resources; Climate change impact; CSOs; Rain water harvesting; Rainwater storage tank; Retention; Storage tank; Stormwater sewers; Water balance models; Climate change","Fewkes A., Butler D., Simulating the performance of rainwater collection systems using behavioural models?, Building Services Engineering Research and Technology, 21, 2, pp. 99-106, (2000); Ghisi E., Ferreira D.F., Potential for potable water savings by using rainwater and greywater in a multi-story residential building in southern Brazil, Building and Environment, 42, 4, pp. 2512-2522, (2007); Guo Y., Baetz B., Sizing of rainwater storage units for Green Building applications, Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, 12, 2, pp. 197-205, (2007); Mwenge-Kahinda J., Taigbenu A., Boroto J., Domestic rainwater harvesting to improve water supply in rural South Africa, Phys.

If sustainable, cities must deliver positive benefits over their possibly long lifetime. Yet in formulating guidance and negotiating design choices for urban development, the consideration of uncertainty and potential future adverse conditions leading to failure is difficult to deal with. In this paper an approach to this issue that can inform the planning and/or urban design process is presented. It is based on a scenario analysis methodology (futures analysis), which herein is used to appraise the energy-efficiency strategies currently recommended in the UK planning system and best practice. The built environment is one of the major consumers of energy, and its energy efficiency is thereby central to any attempt to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Through the analysis, some important factors that could undermine good energy performance emerge. Such findings can lead to the making of decisions that can enhance urban resilience. The first part of the paper provides an overview of the energy-efficient strategies examined, as well as current approaches for considering the evolution of present conditions when planning. The second part presents the futures analysis and its significance is demonstrated through a case study.","Aids; Design methods &; Energy conservation; Urban regeneration","United Kingdom; Carbon dioxide;

This suggests that action to reduce exposure and improve the adaptive capacity of urban populations must therefore simultaneously address disaster risk reduction, urban poverty reduction and urban resilience (i.e. the ability of the city to maintain the functions that support the well-being of its citizens). Based on evidence and experience from 10 cities which form part of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (www.acccrn.org), this article proposes that a simplified conceptual model and resilience characteristics be used to analyse urban systems, in parallel with spatial analysis, to target action at multiple levels to reduce exposure and improve the adaptive capacity of urban populations simultaneously. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Arup.","climate change; governance; poverty; systems approach; urban resilience; urbanisation","climate change; climate effect; environmental management; governance approach; poverty alleviation; urban area; urban population; urbanization","Alcamo J., Hassan R., Scholes R., Ash N., Carpenter S., Pingali P., Bennett E., Zurek M., Chopra K., Leemans R., Ecosystems and human well-being: A framework for assessment (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment), (2003); Antikainen J., The concept of Functional Urban Area, findings of the ESPON project 1.1.1, Inf zur Raumentwickl, 7, pp. 447-456, (2005); Bahadur A., Ibrahim M., Tanner T., The resilience renaissance?

Therefore it describes the history of Hamburg's urban development visions and strategies resulting recently in the vision of ""Metropolis Hamburg -Growing City"". This contains the concept of a ""Leap over the River Elbe"" that connects the city center north of the Elbe with former industrial areas south of the river. Consequently, the chapter explores the so-called ""Elbinsel"", the huge island of Wilhelmsburg situated within the river Elbe, where about 50 000 people live on 100 km2 with wide parts being below sea level. In recent years the awareness of climate change has arisen and has forced the need for new strategies of risk management. New adaptation strategies go along with the planning paradigm ""living with water"" that includes more flexible ways of urban planning in addition to flood protection by dikes. Therefore the chapter presents an innovative flood protection concept -the system of cascading flood compartments -dealing with storm surges and sea level rise. The conclusion of the chapter focuses on the reflection of the system of cascading flood compartments in the context of adaptive capacity.

In order to adopt a different approach, considering not only building and infrastructure vulnerability and according to the goal of managing seismic risk reducing urban vulnerability, it is strategic to identify in peace time (before disastrous events) which elements, which activities, which functions of a city have prior importance after the event, to guarantee a rapid response and the reestablishment of normal conditions: this means identifying the resilient city. This study aims to define a methodological approach to identify the resilient city, adopting spatial multicriteria techniques and establishing resilient system identification considering functional, social, morphological, geological and dimensional characteristics of the considered urban system. In particular, some tests, considering a first set of criteria including accessibility, closeness to urban centres and main facilities, closeness to hydrographical networks, slope, map of seismic hazard, areas at high hydro-geological risk and seismic vulnerability of buildings, have been carried out on a town in Basilicata Region (southern Italy), mainly composed of an old part located on a hilltop, a modern part in the valley and a lot of rural settlements. Multicriteria analysis has been led adopting an additive rule, based on a simple additive weighting method.","Resilient cities; Seismic Risk; Seismic Vulnerability; Spatial Multicriteria Analysis; Urban Vulnerability","Basilicata; Italy; multicriteria analysis; risk assessment; seismic hazard; spatial analysis; urban area; vulnerability","Barnett J., Adapting to Climate Change in Pacific Island Countries: The Problem of Uncertainty, 29, 6, pp. 977-993, (2001); Besio M., Dalla Carta Del Rischio Al Piano Integrato della Sostenibilità Territoriale, (2001); Caldaretti S., Fabietti W., Riggio A., La Vulnerabilità Sismica Dei Sistemi Territoriali, (1987); Chirico A., Et al., Progetto GERIA, la Gestione Dei Rischi Naturali per la Messa in Sicurezza Del Territorio, (2002); Carver S., Integrating multi-criteria evaluation with geographical information systems, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 5, 3, pp. 321-339, (1991); Chakhar S., Mousseau V., An algebra for multicriteria spatial modelling, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 31, 5, pp. 572-596, (2007); Chakhar S., Mousseau V., Spatial multicriteria decision making, Encyclopedia of GIS, (2008); Fabietti W., Vulnerabilità e Trasformazione Dello Spazio Urbano, (1999); Fera G., La Città Antisismica, (1997); Galderisi A., Città e Terremoti, Metodi e Tecniche per la Mitigazione Del Rischio Sismico, (2004); Heywood I., Oliver J., Tomlinson S., Building an explanatory multi-criteria modelling environment for spatial decision support, Innovation in GIS, 2, pp. 127-136, (1995); Holling C.S., Resilience and stability of ecological systems, Review of Ecology and Systematics, 4, pp. 1-23, (1973); Keeney R.L., Siting Energy Facilities, (1980); Las Casas G., Scardaccione G., Contributi per una geografia del rischio sismico: analisi della vulnerabilità e danno differito, Modelli e Metodi per l'Analisi Delle Reti di Trasporto in Condizioni di Emergenza:contributi Metodologici Ed Applicativi, (2005); Malczewski J., GIS and Multicriteria Decision Analysis, (1999); The concept of resilience revisited, Disasters, 30, 4, pp. 433-450, (2006); Mercuri C., La scheda per la valutazione della vulnerabilità urbana, Metodi e Strumenti per i Centri Storici Delle Marche, (2000); Roy B., Multicriteria Methodology for Decision Aiding, (1996); Saaty T.L., The Analytic Hierarchy Process, (1980); Starr M.K., Zeleny M., MCDM: State and future of the arts, Multiple Criteria Decision Making, pp. 5-29, (1977); UNDRO Natural Disasters and Vulnerability Analysis, (1980); Report of the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, (2005); Criteri Generali Per L'Individuazione Delle Zone Sismiche e Per la Formazione e L'Aggiornamento Degli Elenchi Delle Medesime Zone, (2006); Primi Elementi in Materia di Criteri Generali Per la Classificazione del Territorio Nazionale e di Normative Tecniche, (2003)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864193179"

Katrina, the resultant flooding and New Orleans' subsequent on-going recovery demonstrate that the management of flood risk must incorporate new concepts like urban resilience in the city's planning process. The goal of this project is to assess if resilience and related flood mitigation programs have been incorporated into the recovery of New Orleans post-Katrina. We focus on the performance of one particular city neighborhood (Oak Park) within the greater area known as Gentilly. The assessment of Oak Park's urban resilience is made by comparing its' pre and post Katrina condition. A methodology was developed for modeling failure mechanisms by using two operational safety methods: functional analysis as well as a failure mode and effect analysis. When applied to individual neighborhoods, these methods allow failure mechanisms to be modeled as scenarios. In New Orleans' post-Katrina recovery, a strong emphasis has been placed on improving the flood performance of buildings and protective systems but other components and vital functions of the neighborhood have not yet been fully considered.","Indirect vulnerabilities; Performance indicators; Recovery dependences; Resilience; Safety methods; Systems approach","Benchmarking; Parks; Urban planning; Failure mechanism; Failure mode and effect analysis; Flood mitigation; Flood risks; Hurricane katrina; Indirect vulnerabilities; Katrina; Man-made disasters; Modeling failures; Natural disasters; New Orleans; Operational safety; Performance indicators; Performance of buildings; Planning process; Protective systems; Resilience; Systems approach; Urban resilience; Recovery","Balsells M., Amdal J., Barroca B., Diab Y., Serre D., Becue V., Resilience Concepts at Neighborhood Level in Post-Katrina New Orleans recovery, (2011); Campanella T.J., Urban resilience and the recovery of new orleans, American planning association, Journal of the American Planning Association, ProQuest Direct Complete, pp. 141-146, (2006); Campanella R., Geographies of New Orleans, Urban fabrics before de Storm, Center of Louisiana Studies, pp. 45-49, (2006); Folke C., Resilience: The emergence of a perspective for social-ecological systems analyses, Global Environmental Change, 16, 3, pp. 253-267, (2006); GNOCDC: Greater New Orleans Community Data Center; Gunderson L.H., Holling C.S., Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems, (2002); Holling C.S., Resilience and stability of ecological systems, Annu.

Consequently, there is a need for all cities to adapt to climate and socio-economic changes by developing new strategies for flood risk management. Following a risk paradigm shift from traditional to more integrated approaches, and considering the uncertainties of future urban development, one of the main emerging tasks for city managers becomes the development of resilient cities. However, the meaning of the resilience concept and its operability is still not clear. The goal of this research is to study how urban engineering and design disciplines can improve resilience to floods in urban neighbourhoods. This paper presents the conceptual Spatial Decision Support System (DS3) model which we consider a relevant tool to analyse and then implement resilience into neighbourhood design. Using this model, we analyse and discuss alternative stormwater management options at the neighbourhood scale in two specific areas: Rotterdam and New Orleans. The results obtained demonstrate that the DS3 model confirmed in its framework analysis that stormwater management systems can positively contribute to the improved flood resilience of a neighbourhood. © IWA Publishing 2013.","DS3 model; Neighbourhood scale; Stormwater management system; Urban resilience","Cities; Decision Support Techniques; Drainage, Sanitary; Floods; Netherlands; New Orleans; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Decision support systems; Flood control; Floods; Management; Storm sewers; Storms; Urban growth; storm water; Flood risk management; Integrated approach; Neighbourhood; Socio-economic change; Spatial decision support systems; Storm-water managements; Urban engineering; Urban resilience; climate change; decision support system; ecosystem resilience; nature-society relations; neighborhood; numerical model; risk factor; socioeconomic status; stormwater; urban area; urbanization; water management; article; decision support system; ecosystem resilience; neighborhood; United States; urban area; water management; Engineering geology","Ahern J., From fail-safe to safe-to-fail: Sustainability and resilience in the new urban world, Landscape and Urban Planning, 100, 4, pp. 341-343, (2011); Barroca B., Serre D., Diab Y., Le Concept de Résilience à L'épreuve du Génie Urbain (The Concept of Resilience to Proof Urban Engineering), (2012); Campanella R., Geographies of New Orleans, Urban Fabrics before the Storm, (2006); Chammah E., Rotterdam Water City 2035, European Urban Waterscapes, (2007); Colten C.E., Kates R.W., Laska S.B., Community Resilience: Lessons from New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina, CARRI Research Report 3, pp. 1-5, (2008); De Brujin K.M., Resilience and Flood Risk Management.

Mining capitalists and colonial, as well as apartheid, governments tended to resist urban permanence, but they were usually unable to stop it. Economists and social anthropologists, being less conscious than historians of the cyclical nature of mining, have been prone to discount the remarkable tenacity of the Zambian Copperbelt's urban residents in the face of mining downturns. By contrast, very little attention in the literature has been paid to the decline of gold mining in South Africa. In view of the Zambian precedent for urban resilience, it would be unwise to overlook the continuing influence of South African mining on urban settlement in spite of the industry's gradual decline over the last four decades. The patterns of development of new platinum mines in South Africa and new copper mines in Zambia show certain similarities and historical continuities, including a reluctance on the part of mining companies to accept responsibility for the housing and welfare of all their workers and their families. © 2012 The International Society for Diatom Research.","Copper; Gold; Housing; Mineworkers; Platinum; Welfare","Copperbelt; South Africa; Zambia; Zimbabwe; apartheid; copper; gold mine; historical geography; historical perspective; housing; human settlement; mining; platinum; welfare economics","Auty R.M., Sustaining Development in Mineral Economies: The Resource Curse, (1993); Beall J., Crankshaw O., Parnell S., Uniting A Divided City: Governance and Social Exclusion in Johannesburg, (2002); Beinart W., The Political Economy of Pondoland, 1860 to 1930, (1982); Bonner P., Segal L., Soweto, A City, (1998); Chamber of Mines of Zambia Presentation to the Public Discussion Forum to Be Made on 16 July at Solwezi, (2010); Annual Report, (2011); Chipkin C.M., Johannesburg Style: Architecture and Society, 1880s-1960s, (1993); Crush J., Jeeves A., Yudelman D., South Africa's Labor Empire: A History of Black Migrancy to the Gold Mines, (1991); Crush J., James W., Depopulating the compounds: Migrant labor and mine housing in South Africa, World Development, 19, 4, pp. 301-316, (2002); Davis J.M., Modern Industry and the African, (1933); Delius P., The Land Belongs to Us, (1983); England A., South African gold town struggles to find a future, Financial Times, (2012); Ferguson J., Mobile workers, modernist narratives: A critique of the historiography of transition on the Zambian Copperbelt, Part 1, Journal of Southern African Studies, 16, 3, pp. 385-412, (1990); Ferguson J., Mobile workers, modernist narratives: A critique of the historiography of transition on the Zambian Copperbelt', Part 2, Journal of Southern African Studies, 16, 4, pp. 603-612, (1990); Ferguson J., Modernist narratives, conventional wisdoms, and colonial liberalism: Reply to a straw man, Journal of Southern African Studies, 20, 4, pp. 633-640, (1994); Ferguson J., Expectations of Modernity: Myths and Meanings of Urban Life on the Zambian Copperbelt, (1999); Gewald J.-B., Soeters S., African miners and shape-shifting capital flight: The case of Luanshya-Baluba, Zambia, Mining and Neoliberalism: Boom and Bust on the Globalized Copperbelt, pp. 155-184, (2010); Gregory T., Ernest Oppenheimer and the Economic Development of Southern Africa, (1962); Hansungule M., Feeney P., Palmer R., Report on Land Insecurity on the Zambian Copperbelt, (1998); Harries P., Work, Culture and Identity: Migrant Laborers in Mozambique and South Africa, 1860-1910, (1994); Innes D., Anglo: Anglo American and the Rise of Modern South Africa, (1984); Narrowing the Gaps: Planning for Basic Needs and Productive Employment in Zambia, (1977); Jeeves A., Migrant Labour in South Africa's Mining Economy, 1890-1920, (1985); Krikler J., The Rand Revolt: The 1922 Insurrection and Racial Killing in South Africa, (2005); Lacey M., Working for Boroko: The Origins of A Coercive Labour System in South Africa, (1981); Lipton M., Capitalism and Apartheid: South Africa, 1910-6, (1985); Lipton M., Liberals, Marxists and Capitalists: Competing Interpretations of South African History, (2007); MacMillan H., The historiography of transition on the Zambian Copperbelt - Another view, Journal of Southern African Studies, 19, 4, pp. 681-712, (1993); MacMillan H., More thoughts on the historiography of transition on the Zambian Copperbelt, Journal of Southern African Studies, 22, 2, pp. 309-312, (1996); Nattrass N., The crisis in South African gold mining, World Development, 23, 5, pp. 857-868, (1995); Perrings C., Black Mineworkers in Central Africa, (1979); Potts D., Counter-urbanisation on the Copperbelt: Interpretations and implications, Urban Studies, 42, 4, pp. 583-609, (2005); Potts D., Circular Migration in Zimbabwe and Contemporary Sub-Saharan Africa, (2010); Race Relations Survey 1984, (1985); Rajak D., Platinum city and the new South African dream, Africa, 82, 2, pp. 252-271, (2012); Robinson E.A.G., The economic problem, Modern Industry and the African, pp. 136-174, (1933); Shell R.C.H., Children of Bondage: A Social History of the Slave Society at the Cape of Good Hope, 1652-1838, (1994); South Africa Survey, 2010-11, (2011); Turrell R., Capital and Labour on the Kimberley Diamond Fields, (1987); Watson W., Tribal Cohesion in A Money Economy: A Study of the Mambwe People of Zambia, (1958); Wilson F., Labour in the South African Gold Mines, 1911-69, (1972); Worger W., Kimberley: South Africa's City of Diamonds, (1987); 2010 Census of Population and Housing: Preliminary Report, (2011)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84873676148"

Contemporary flood risk analyses generally include only direct economic damages and fail to consider other flood risks, such as disruption to the economy or the loss of life, which may be mitigated by building resilience into high value assets, critical infrastructure systems and urban communities. The infrastructure networks are critical for the continuity of economic activities as well as for the people's basic living needs. Resilience in cities depends both on its physical form and characteristics as well as on the people's capacity, and social behavior. There is a growing recognition that innovative planning approaches and processes based on these resilience principles will guide citizens and other stakeholders the way to become co-producers of a sustainable community that can respond to change and disruption, and pro-actively reduce vulnerabilities. In most industrialized countries, the building stock and infrastructure are mainly ageing and there is much heritage. In the coming decades, the redevelopment (c.f. renovation and modernization) of the existing stock is a high priority and certainly of higher priority than the provision of new housing. Redevelopment projects may thus provide windows of opportunity to make adjustments in the process of urban renewal in order to correct old mistakes and to build resilience by adapting and restructuring the urban fabric to new conditions of increased flood risk. Some cities in the developing world, however, is not often constrained by significant past investments, and much of the change in their urban fabric is to come in the next few decades. There is a huge challenge to exploit this momentum. If we are able to seize these windows of opportunity and share good practices via city-to-city networks stretching across country boundaries and other social networks, than we can create the groundswell for real practical change towards flood-resilient cities at a global level. This can convert the challenge into an opportunity. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.","","Critical infrastructures; Developing countries; Economics; Investments; Office buildings; Risk management; Building stocks; Commercial building; Critical infrastructure systems; Developing world; Economic activities; Economic damages; Flood risk analysis; Flood risks; Global levels; Good practices; Industrialized countries; Infrastructure networks; Loss of life; Redevelopment project; Renovation and Modernization; Social behavior; Social Networks; Sustainable communities; Urban community; Urban fabrics; Urban flooding; Urban renewal; Floods","Adikari Y., Osti R., Noro T., Flood-related disaster vulnerability: An impending crisis of megacities in asia, Journal of Flood Risk Management, 3, pp. 185-191, (2010); Birkmann J., Garschagen M., Kraas F., Quang N., Adaptive urban governance: New challenges for the second generation of urban adaptation strategies to climate change, Sustain Sci, 5, pp. 185-206, (2010); Strategic research agenda for the european construction sector, European Construction Technology Platform, (2005); Evans E.P., Ashley R.M., Hall J., Penning-Rowsell E., Saul A., Sayers P., Thorne C., Watkinson A., Foresight.

Urban form, the spatial distribution of activities and urban organization are crucial aspects of cities' sustainability. Many tools and assessment systems have been developed to improve cities' energy efficiency and environmental footprint. However, most of these tools are based on the building scale. Most urban stakeholders are now convinced that a building scale approach is not sufficient: the scale of analysis should evolve from the building to the neighbourhood, district and city scales. An innovative system of indicators is presented that answers the need for multi-scale and cross-scale indicators and encompasses the intrinsic complexity of the city. Based on a morphologic approach, new mathematical formulas are used to generate urban sustainability indicators. These indicators can assist with the comparison of urban projects by using a structural point of view to assess the energy efficiency, social and environmental consequences of different urban forms.

There is growing interest in applying resilience to address the challenges of urban climate change. The application of resilience theory has considerable potential for furthering our understanding of the particulars of urban climate vulnerability with its emphasis on complex systems that are increasingly important to urban life. But there are also significant risks. Resilience theory does not adequately address critical issues of power, voice and equity. Moreover, much of the uptake of resilience is as a buzzword rather than a conceptual framework. As such, the discourse of resilience has connotations that can run counter to interests of poverty reduction. Drawing on experience in Asia, the authors argue for a critical application of resilience, with special attention to concerns of resilience for and by whom. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Poverty; Systems; Urban climate resilience; Vulnerability","","Adger N., Vulnerability, Global Environmental Change, 16, 3, pp. 268-281, (2006); Poverty Analysis Discussion Group, (2012); Apthorpe R., Writing development policy and policy analysis plain or clear: on language, genre and power, Anthropology of Policy: Critical perspectives on Governance and Power, pp. 43-58, (1997); Arthur R.I., Friend R.M., Marschke M., Making adaptive co-management more than a marriage of convenience: reconciling theory and practice in the management of fisheries in the Mekong region, Collaboration for Resilience: Cases in Community Building and Resource Management, pp. 255-281, (2011); Bahadur A.V., Ibrahim M., Tanner T., The resilience renaissance?

The chapter applies a critical perspective on the present urban development trajectory of the Stockholm metropolitan area. It emphasizes the need to understand ways in which informally managed green spaces contribute to ecological functions in urban settings. The chapter provides a background of the Stockholm region and the current challenges it faces, followed by a synthesis of the major insights conveyed in SUA related to informal ecosystem management.

A form of resilience focusing narrowly on natural and human-caused disasters replaces broader responses to risks, which address economic and personal hardship. Concurrently, combined effects of neoliberal societal arrangements and economic globalization exacerbate economic risks to which individuals and communities are exposed. A discussion of the shrinking city phenomenon demonstrates that economic hazards, against which most resilience measures are helpless, represent a peril that is more common than, and often at least as destructive as, the disasters targeted by mainstream resilience approaches. The experience of shrinking cities points to the dual impact of their contracting economies: direct threats to the wellbeing and survival of their residents, and a depletion of the intervention capacity of agencies responsible for different aspects of urban resilience. The paper closes with an examination of realistic means of enhancing resilience in the present neoliberal context. © Author(s) 2014.","Globalization; Neoliberalism; Shrinking cities; Urban resilience","","Accordino J., Johnson G.T., Addressing the vacant and abandoned property problem, Journal of Urban Affairs, 22, pp. 301-315, (2000);

Increasing complexity of the urban context, gradual loss of tacit knowledge and decreasing social awareness are at the same time leading to inadequate choices with respect to urban flood risk management (UFRM). The European Flood Risk Directive emphasises the need for non-structural measures aimed at urban resilience and social preparedness. The Three Points Approach (3PA) provides a structure facilitating the decision making processes dealing with UFRM. It helps to accept the complexity of the urban context and promotes transdisciplinarity and multifunctionality. The 3PA introduces three domains wherein water professionals may act and where aspects valued by different stakeholders come into play: (1) technical optimisation, dealing with standards and guidelines for urban drainage systems; (2) spatial planning, making the urban area more resilient to future changing conditions; and (3) day-to-day values, enhancing awareness, acceptance and participation among stakeholders. Based on in-depth interviews conducted in The Netherlands and Denmark, we describe the complexity of decision making in practical UFRM and explain how the 3PA can be used when organising participatory processes. We introduce a theoretical framework characterising the large range of aspects involved in decision making related to UFRM and evaluate the usefulness of the 3PA in dealing with it. We conclude that the 3PA offers water managers and operators an efficient communication tool and thinking system, which helps to reduce complexity to a level suitable when organising strategy plans for UFRM and urban adaptation to climate change. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","complexity; decision making; process management; resilience; social values; spatial planning; water aspects","Netherlands; adaptive management; climate change; decision making; drainage network; flood control; participatory approach; risk assessment; spatial planning; stakeholder; urban area; urban planning; water management","Abebe A.J., Price R.K., Decision support system for urban flood management, Journal of Hydroinformatics, 7, 1, pp. 3-15, (2005); Ahern J., From fail-safe to safe-to-fail: Sustainability and resilience in the new urban world, Landscape and Urban Planning, 100, pp. 341-343, (2011); Arnbjerg-Nielsen K., Quantification of climate change effects on extreme precipitation used for high resolution hydrologic design, Urban Water Journal, 9, pp. 57-65, (2012); Ashley R.M., Towards integrated approaches to reduce flood risk in urban areas, Advance in Urban Flood Management, pp. 415-432, (2007); Ashley R.M., Sewer system design moving into the 21st century - a UK perspective, Water Science & Technology, 55, 4, pp. 273-281, (2007); Bak P., How nature works, the science of self-organize criticality, (1996); Bomans K., Underrated transformations in the open space - the case of an urbanized and multifunctional area, Landscape and Urban Planning, 94, pp. 196-205, (2010); Brilly M., Local flood defence systems in europe, Advance in urban flood management, (2007); Brown R., Impediments to integrated urban stormwater management: the need for institutional reforms, Environmental Management, 36, 3, pp. 455-468, (2005); Butler D., Davies J.W., Urban drainage, (2000); Drain and sewer systems outside buildings, (2008); White paper - adapting to climate change: Towards a European framework for action; Dooyeweerd H., A new critique of theoretical thought, (1953); Directive 2007/60/EC on the assessment and management of flood risks, (2007); Sustaining the multiple functions of agricultural biodiversity: background paper 1: agricultural biodiversity, FAO/NL Conference on the Multifunctional Character of Agriculture and Land, (1999); Fussel H.M., Vulnerability: a generally applicable conceptual framework for climate change research, Global Environmental Change, 17, 2, pp. 155-167, (2007); Fussel H.M., Klein R.J.T., Climate change vulnerability assessments: an evolution of conceptual thinking, Climatic Change, 75, pp. 301-329, (2006); Gehl J., Life between buildings: Using public space, (1987); Gehl J., Cities for people, (2010); Geldof D.G., Policy analysis and complexity - a non-equilibrium approach for integrated water management, Water Science and Technology, 31, 8, pp. 301-309, (1995); Geldof D.G., Adaptive water management: integrated water management on the edge of chaos, Water Science and Technology, 32, 1, pp. 7-13, (1995); Geldof D.G., Coping with complexity in integrated water management.

The first is based on the concept of a 'foodshed' and puts the accent on sustainability and 'resilience', while the second refers to the notion of 'terroir', with the emphasis on oneness and the intrinsic value of locally produced food. Through a reading of English and Italian case histories, the essay critically analyses the two approaches, their feasibility and the different results achieved in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The analysis is organised in two sections, each of which introduces the case history with a brief theoretical introduction. In the conclusions, the antynomy between the two approaches is re-examined and possible research developments on the subject are identified.

This chapter surveys four scenarios for the future as we face this crisis of crises: (1) civilizational collapse, (2) sustainable enclaves for the wealthy, (3) urban deconstruction and re-ruralization, and (4) a meta-industrial society comprised of resilient cities and sustainable bioregions. While all four scenarios are likely to be simultaneously present in the decades ahead, it is argued that only the meta-industrial vision is capable of inspiring the thought and action necessary for us to change our direction and respond creatively and effectively to the great challenges of our time. Based on the principles of tolerance and cooperative community and supported by the intelligent use of environmentally and humanly appropriate technology, the meta-industrial society is comprised of resilient and sustainable human settlements. The characteristics of resilient and sustainable cities are defined and illustrated by a case study of the sustainable urban district of Kronsberg (Hannover), Germany. It is concluded that the only way to create an equitable, socially just, and environmentally sustainable human ecology is to integrate social policy and environmental policy into a seamless whole that results in the creation of new communities such as Kronsberg and the transformation of existing metropolitan areas into a polycentric pattern of mixed-use, humanly scaled, resilient cities and regenerative agricultural landscapes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The first one is the general question of urban resilience, assumed in its relational meaning: the capacity of an urban system, thanks to the features of its spatial elements, to take abruptly imposed transformations, without significantly changing their mutual relations and hence the whole urban geography: and the transformation imposed by an earthquake (its destruction as well as the successive reconstruction) are undoubtedly sudden and abrupt. A discussion will hence be aimed at determining some configurational parameters, suitable for reproducing the capability of a spatial system to sustain sudden changes and yet to retain its inner working mechanisms. The second theme more specifically concerns the matter of earthquakes, and will here be aimed at investigating the effect of a seismic event on the inner geography of an urban settlement, thus verifying on several case studies the effects of an earthquake as well as the reliability of space syntax to describe their actual resilience. Summing all up, this paper aims at pinpointing the configurational features, if any, suitable for reproducing and accounting for the level of resilience a settlement is provided with, and -afterwards - at testing them on urban cases actually affected by earthquake destructions. The main case study here assumed is the settlement of L'Aquila, in Italy, with reference to the devastating earthquake of April, 6th 2009. The configuration analysis has been applied to the spatial consistencies respectively referred to three distinct phases: - before the earthquake; - soon after the earthquake (temporary, but still present situation); - after the earthquake, definitive (yet distant to come) situation, including the forthcoming reconstruction of the perished areas and the new development areas (at L'Aquila, the so-called 'CASE' project). Some significant outcome can be drawn. First, this approach allows highlighting the dramatic transformation an earthquake, like other natural disasters, is likely to cause to the inner geography of a settlement, upsetting the distribution of movement flows and the levels of attractiveness and centrality. Even more, the configurational analysis will reveal the likely effects the reconstruction and rehabilitation plans and projects on the variables of the urban system, over and above the fulfilment of recovery claim and the housing supplying. More in general, it will report the far-reaching and long-lasting relevance of urban plans worked out in emergency situation, under the pressure of need and urgency. On such basis, the method is here proposed as a suitable tool for supporting and orienting the temporary (yet often enduring) post-earthquake phase as well as the successive reconstruction planning.","Centrality; Earthquake; Grid configuration; Reconstruction; Town planning","Disasters; Geophysics; Image reconstruction; Syntactics; Centrality; Configuration analysis; Earthquake destruction; Emergency situation; Grid configurations; Post-earthquake reconstruction; Spatial consistency; Town planning; Earthquakes","Dynes R.R., The Lisbon Earthqualke in 1755; Contested Meanings of the First Modern Disaster, (1997); Fischler I.A., Firschein O., Intelligence: The Eye, the Brain, and the Computer, (1987); Gil J., Steinbach P., From flood risk to indirect flood impact: Evaluation of street network performance for effective management, response and repair, Flood Recovery, Innovation and Response (FRIAR 2008), pp. 335-345, (2008); Godfrey B.J., Urban development and redevelopment in San Francisco, The Geographical Review, 87, 3, pp. 309-333, (1997); Miles S.B., Stephanie E., Chang S., A Simulation Model of Urban Disaster Recovery and Resilience : Implementation for the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, (2007); Nimis G.P., La Ricostruzione Possibile: La Ricostruzione Nel Centro Storico di Gemona Del Friuli Dopo Il Terremoto Del 1976, (1988); Heitor T., Kruger M., Muchagato J., Ramos T., Tostoes A., Breaking of the medieval space.

As a consequence, city authorities are increasingly facing the challenge of finding ways to include adaptation strategies into their work, although related knowledge and competence is still scarce and fragmented. With the aim to contribute to knowledge development and organizational learning, the objective of this paper is to critically review and compare current theoretical and practical approaches to adaptation planning in cities. In order to do so, first the conceptual characteristics and features of a climate resilient city are identified. Second, the reciprocal linkages between climate-related disasters, urban form and city planning processes are analysed - by considering the life cycle of disasters from causes, to short- and long-term impacts, to post-disaster response and recovery. Finally, urban adaptation measures proposed for both developed and so-called developing countries are assessed. On the basis of the identified differences, gaps and synergies between the theoretical and practical approaches to adaptation planning, the implications for improving sustainable urban transformation are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The important synergistic impacts coexisting with freshwater scarcity are increasing urbanization rates, subsiding soils, saltwater intrusion in aquifers and rivers, coastal erosion, and increased flooding. Innovative design strategies and concepts for the integration of decentralized rainwater management measures can contribute to the integrated and climate resilient planning of urban spaces that are threatened by climate change scenarios that worsen the security of urban infrastructures and the future availability of fresh water. Decentralized rainwater management, including retention, storage, and reuse strategies that are integrated into spatial planning and urban design, can reduce flood risks while simultaneously enhancing freshwater availability. This paper discusses a paradigm shift in urban water management, from centralized to decentralized management (that is, from threats to opportunities), using the example of two case studies. Concepts and strategies for building climate resilient cities, which address flood control, the protection of freshwater resources, and the harmonization of a natural and more sustainable water balance, are presented for Almere (Rhine Schelde Delta, The Netherlands) and Hsingchu (Dotzpu Delta, Taiwan). © 2013 by the authors;.","Almere; Climate change; Climate resilience; Decentralized rainwater management; Flooding; Freshwater scarcity; Hsingchu; Urban development","Almere; Flevoland; Hsinchu; Netherlands; Taiwan; Aquifers; Availability; Climate change; Design; Flood control; Floods; Hydrogeology; Oil well flooding; Urban growth; Water; Water conservation; Almere; Climate resilience; Freshwater scarcity; Hsingchu; Rainwater management; Urban development; climate change; coastal zone management; decentralization; flooding; freshwater; rainwater; sustainability; urban design; urban development; urban planning; urbanization; water availability; water management; water resource; Water management","McGranahan G., Balk D., Anderson B., The rising tide: Assessing the risks of climate change and human settlements in low elevation coastal zones, Environ.

In examining how experiments take effect, we suggest that we need to understand not only how they are made and assembled, but also how they are maintained within specific urban contexts. Drawing on literatures from urban political ecology and the specific debate on urban repair and maintenance, this article examines maintenance in two case studies of climate change experiments in housing in Bangalore (India) and Monterrey (Mexico). We find that maintenance is a crucial process through which not only urban obduracy is preserved, but also the novel and innovative character of the experiment is asserted and reproduced. The process of 'maintaining' experiments is a precarious one, which requires a continuous external input in terms of remaking the experiment materially and discursively. This process causes further reconfigurations beyond the experiment, changing the patterns of responsibility attribution and acceptability that configure the urban fabric. © 2013 Urban Research Publications Limited.","Bangalore; Climate change; Experiments; India; Infrastructure; Maintenance; Mexico; Monterrey; Urban political ecology","Bangalore; India; Karnataka; Mexico [North America]; Monterrey; Nuevo Leon; climate change; infrastructure; urban area; urban climate; urban planning","Brand S., How buildings learn: what happens after they're built, (1994); Bulkeley H., Cities and the governing of climate change, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 35, 1, pp. 229-253, (2010); Bulkeley H., Castan Broto V., Government by experiment?

It puts the social component of the city into relationship with the destroyed and dangerous urban environment. In the period between 1992 and 1996 in Sarajevo and in other Bosnian cities, survival became the most important activity for citizens. In the period directly preceding the war, urban conditions—mobility, infrastructure, and services—started to malfunction. As a result, ordinary city life became an object of new urban imageries influenced by new urban conditions and rules of behavior. The first bombing of the city on 6 April 1992 was a sign that the war had started. It brought with it war urban conditions: lack of public transport, electricity, water, and food. The inability of the city and the people living in it to function normally demanded new patterns of urban resilience, which were partly a product of the city’s prewar conditions. Using Sarajevo as a case study, this article examines whether the city had predisaster coping strategies and, if so, the extent to which these plans were used during the war. Finally, the article observes how citizens, with their own imageries about cities, can participate in the creation of patterns of urban resilience and future predisaster strategies. © 2012, The Author(s).","patterns of urban resilience; Sarajevo; urban conditions; urban imageries; war","","Alexander C., Ishikawa S., Silverstein M., Jacobson M., King I., Angel S., A Pattern Language, (1997); Ashwort G.J., War and the City, (1991); Bobic M., A Timless Pattern Language.

However, they were always rebuilt and rebounded. After about 1800, such resilience became a nearly universal fact of urban settlement around world. Urban disaster takes many forms and can be categorized in many ways, like scale of destruction, human troll, natural disasters and etc. Because of these kinds of disasters, the cities need to be resilient and need to adapt upcoming conditions. Although there are many different forms of disasters, this study is more concerned about the ones that are caused by humans and that can be prevented or at least with the ones which something still can be done about. In other words, this study is about importance of resilient cities and adapting existing cities to the future. This research is about energy efficient buildings, clean and renewable energy resources, improved transportation options, reduced waste and industrial pollution and adapting to new conditions so that cities can be sustainable and their residents can continue their urban life without extreme shocks and stresses. While studying resilience and adaptation, Chicago Metropolitan Area will be the case study. Chicago?s main struggle begins with the Great Fire in 1871, and continues with Great Depression in 1930. The World War II effects and still continues with problems that are caused by people?s modern lifestyle, like heat islands or greenhouse gas emissions. For more than fifteen years, Chicago has been promoting the transformation into an environmentally friendly city. From green roofs to recycling, Chicago continues to take steps toward resiliency against climate change. Currently, not only the local government but also the business community and residents at large have engaged in a multitude of key partnerships and efforts to support the city?s goal. Scientists, businesses and governments around the world agree: climate change is one of the most serious issues facing the Earth today. In the last 50 years, levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have risen 25 percent; levels of methane, an even more potent greenhouse gas, have more than doubled. Because of these increases in heat-trapping gases, under a high-emissions scenario, recent predictions show that by the end of the century, annual average temperature could increase up to four degrees Celsius, and every single part of the Earth will be affected with climate change. Developed countries started to take action against climate change. They are developing strategies that can be applied by even developing countries, such as Turkey, and surely these strategies can be used as a road map to strength Turkish cities against incoming climate change.","Adaptation; Chicago; Climatechange; Resilient cities","","Climate Link with Killer Cyclones Spurs Fierce Scientific Debate, (2008); Archer D., Rahmstorf S., The Climate Crisis: An Introductory Guide to Climate change, (2010); Ash C., Jasny B., Roberts L., Stone R., Sugden A., Reimagining Cities Science, 319, 5864, (2008); Bicknell J., Dodman D., Satterthwaite D., Adapting Cities to Climate Change: Understanding and Addressing The Development Challenges, (2009); Chicago Greenhouse Gas Emissions: An Inventory, (2008); Chappell S.A.K., Chicago's Urban Nature: A Guide to The City's Architecture and Landscape, (2007); Chicago Climate Action Plan Natural Environment Adaptation Working Draft, (2011); Chicago Climate Action Plan-Transportation Strategy, (2009); Chicago Climate Action Plan Full Report, (2009); Chicago Climate Action Plan Progress Report-First Two Years, (2009); Bike 2015 Plan, (2006); The Bike 2000 Plan, (1991); Guidelines for a Comprehensive Bicycle Route System, (1967); Gurevin S., Resilient cities and adaptation case study: Chicago metropolitan area, (2012); Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report-An Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2007); Kenworthy J., Laube P., Newman P., Barter T., Raad C.P., Guia B., An International Sourcebook of Automobile Dependence in Cities, (1999); Mazria E., Urban Land, (2007); Munasinghe M., Swart R., Primer on Climate Change and Sustainable Development, (2004); Newman P., Beatley T., Boyer H., Resilient Cities: Responding to Peak Oil and Climate Change, (2008); Newman P., Kenworthy J., Greening Urban Transport, (2007); Schneider S.H., Rosencranz A., Niles J.O., Climate Change Policy: A Survey, (2002); White I., Water and the City: Risk, (2010); State of the World 2007: Our Urban Future, (2007)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84894635935"

We first describe the French regulatory framework in risk management, the latest evolutions and its drawbacks in making cities both resilient and sustainable. Indeed, we argue that local authorities lack technical skills, organizational powers and resilience culture in promoting an integrated management though the latest French and European strategies are pushing in this direction. Given this context, the Resilis project, funded by the French National Research Agency and lead by Egis, aims at providing a new offer for municipalities willing to assess and improve their territory's resilience.

The rising groundwater as a secondary effect of these floods induces additional damage, particularly in the basements of buildings. Mostly, these losses remain underestimated, because they are difficult to assess, especially for the entire building stock of flood-prone urban areas. For this purpose an appropriate methodology has been developed and lead to a groundwater damage simulation model named GRUWAD. The overall methodology combines various engineering and geoinformatic methods to calculate major damage processes by high groundwater levels. It considers a classification of buildings by building types, synthetic depth-damage functions for groundwater inundation as well as the results of a groundwater-flow model. The modular structure of this procedure can be adapted in the level of detail. Hence, the model allows damage calculations from the local to the regional scale. Among others it can be used to prepare risk maps, for ex-ante analysis of future risks, and to simulate the effects of mitigation measures. Therefore, the model is a multifarious tool for determining urban resilience with respect to high groundwater levels. © Author(s) 2012.","","building construction; computer simulation; estimation method; flood; GIS; groundwater flow; numerical model; subterranean environment; surface water; urban area","Arlt G., Blum A., Gruhler K., Lehmann I., Siedlungsraumbezogene Stadtstrukturtypen [Urban structure types in settlement areas], Typologien der Gebauten Umwelt - Modellierung und Analyse der Siedlungsentwicklung Mit Dem Strukturtypenansatz, (2010); Bauer P., Gumbricht T., Kinzelbach W., A regional coupled surface water/groundwater model of the okavango delta, botswana, Water Resour Res, 42, (2006); Cobby D., Morris S., Parkes A., Robinson V., Groundwater flood risk management: Advances towards meeting the requirements of the EU floods directive, J.

Ensured by its unique location, Istanbul has always been a remarkable coastal city, throughout its long history dating back to 660 BC. Today this unique location poses a threat to the city. Under the Sea of Marmara, tectonic plates move on one of the most active geologic boundaries in the world, named as the North Anatolian Fault. Existing in an earthquake prone area, the city will probably confront a major earthquake within two decades time. Scientific studies and Earthquake Master Plan for Istanbul highlight the disaster vulnerability of megacity. Today, cities need to improve themselves to resilient ones in order to cope with the challenges of 21st century. This study is an attempt to reveal the power of landscape planning for building this resiliency. Regarding their proximity to the earthquake fault line, southern coastal districts of Istanbul are subject to several earthquake risk analysis and hazard assessments. However, required disaster mitigation studies are still lacking for most of the coastal districts. Seeking to reveal the power of landscape planning in disaster mitigation, this study is utilizing GIS technology and focusing on one of the most significant hazard prone coastal districts of Istanbul called Kadiköy. Due to its dense built space structure, close proximity to the fault line, 3 major urban streams and coastal landfills, Kadiköy is a vulnerable coastal district to the impacts of the major earthquake and the accompanying secondary disasters such as tsunami, liquefaction, landslide and fire. Within this study, mitigation capacities of open spaces are evaluated according to nine major parameters which are ownership, interaction with the secondary hazards, slope, land cover, size, accessibility, perceptibility, provision of technical infrastructure and proximity to sociocultural infrastructures. These analyses indicate that major public open spaces of Kadiköy district cannot be utilized for the social benefit during the post-earthquake period as they are located on tsunami hit areas or along the riverfronts. However, this study proves that it is possible to improve existing green structure of Kadiköy district and utilize the green structure for the purposes of evacuation, gathering and sheltering. Today, there is an urgent need for turning Istanbul into a disaster resilient city. This study highlights the importance of disaster sensitive landscape planning for building disaster resiliency, regarding the benefit of Istanbul megacity and the other hazard prone cities.","","Earthquakes; Geographic information systems; Hazards; Tsunamis; Disaster mitigation; Disaster vulnerability; Earthquake risk analysis; Landscape planning; North Anatolian Fault; Scientific studies; Secondary disasters; Technical infrastructure; Disasters","Alpar B., Altinok Y., Gazioglu C., Yucel Z.Y., Tsunami hazard assessment in Istanbul, Turkish Journal Marine Sciences, 9, 1, pp. 3-29, (2003); Alarslan E., Arising risks in urban settlements: How can urban settlements be made disaster-resilient in light of increasingly devastating natural disasters over the last decade?, International Journal of Urban Sciences, 12, 1, pp. 49-60, (2008); Gencer E., Risk management strategies for the predicted earthquake hazard in Istanbul, Coping with Global Environmental Change, Disasters and Security, pp. 655-668, (2011); Identification of elements at risk for a credible tsunami event for Istanbul, Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 12, pp. 107-119, (2012); Geological - Geotechnical Study Final Report According to the Construction Plans as a Result of Settlement Purposed Microzonation Works, (2007); The Study on a Disaster Prevention/mitigation Basic Plan in Istanbul including Seismic Microzonation, (2002); Kundak S., Turkoglu H., Earthquake risk assessment for Istanbul, ITÜ Journal A, 6, 2, pp. 37-46, (2007); Ratajczak W., A systems view of urban sustainability and creativity: Vulnerability, resilience and XXQ of cities, Sustainable City and Creativity, pp. 98-115, (2011); Turer Baskaya F.A., Understanding the power of landscape in building a disaster resilient city from Istanbul, Proceedings of ECLAS Conference 2012, pp. 272-276, (2012); Living with Risk: A Global Review of Disaster Reduction Initiatives, 2, (2004); Vale L.J., Campanella T.J., The Resilient City: How Modern Cities Recover from Disaster, (2005)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84900843984"

Recent attention to biophilic design among architects and designers acknowledges this power of nature. However, in an increasingly urban planet, more attention needs to be aimed at the urban scales, at planning for and moving towards what the authors call ""biophilic cities"". Biophilic cities are cities that provide close and daily contact with nature, nearby nature, but also seek to foster an awareness of and caring for this nature. Biophilic cities, it is argued here, are also sustainable and resilient cities. Achieving the conditions of a biophilic city will go far in helping to foster social and landscape resilience, in the face of climate change, natural disasters and economic uncertainty and various other shocks that cities will face in the future. The paper identifies key pathways by which biophilic urbanism enhances resilience, and while some are well-established relationships, others are more tentative and suggest future research and testing. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Biophilic cities; Resilient cities; Sustainable cities","architectural design; climate change; natural disaster; sustainability; urban design; urban development; urban planning; urbanization","Wilson E.O., Biophilia and the conservation ethic.

At the level of Systems Thinking there is a very close relationship between resilience in the behavior of natural (ecological) systems and resilience in the social dynamics of governance within communities, where such resilience establishes the viability of these communities over centuries, which in turn entails successful stewardship of the man-environment relationship. We use insights from this cross-system mapping - across natural, built, and human systems - to assess, first, the role of city governance in achieving nexus security (or not) and, second, the role of technological innovations in serving the same purpose. More specifically, eight principles, covering resilience and diversity of access to resources and services, are used to gauge security-enhancing features of city buildings and infrastructure. Case studies include new designs of resilient office blocks, nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) recovery systems for sanitation and wastewater treatment, and the reconstruction of urban parks for the provision of ecosystem services. Throughout the paper, matters of risk in the face of meteorological variability are prominent. We do not conclude, however, that the presence of risk implies nexus insecurity. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","cities as forces for good; climate variability; ecosystem services; energy and nutrient recovery; infrastructure failure; urban metabolism","","Cook C., Bakker K., Water security: debating an emerging paradigm, Global Environmental Change, 22, 1, pp. 94-102, (2012); Towards Water Security: A Framework for Action, (2000); Grey D., Sadoff C.W., Sink or swim?

Among the population groups affected by disaster, children are particularly vulnerable. Responsible disaster intervention requires both top-down and bottom-up preparation that endorses an ecological perspective, taking into consideration the impact upon individuals and families as well as on neighborhoods and entire communities. In such an approach, preventive and post-disaster interventions with children should be integrated with community leadership, local schools, welfare units, social institutions and medical centers. Objective: In this paper we briefly summarize how disaster affects children and their protective matrix. We further discuss the concept of personal and community resilience, its definitions and components. The worldview of this system-oriented approach encompasses perceptions of public health and administration, community capital and resilience and preventive education. Results: We describe what makes a community a resilient one, and the role played by preparedness. Finally, we describe the Cohen-Harris Model of Urban Resilience, its rationale, and its four resilience programs (health/mental health, population, information and school resilience).In this model, the local authority serves as the command center for emergency preparedness and resilience is developed through everyday activities that are an integral part of the urban routine. Conclusions: This model relies on interest in child welfare to enlist leaders, institutions and communities to act as well to motivate the entire community and to implement far-reaching and systemic changes. Interest in all aspects of children's lives serves to integrate the actions of families, organizations and communities. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Children; Community; Disaster; Resilience","","Berger R., Gelkopf M., School-based intervention for the treatment of tsunami-related distress in children: A quasi-randomized controlled trial, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, 78, pp. 364-371, (2009); Berger R., Pat-Horenczyk R., Gelkopf M., School-based intervention for prevention and treatment of elementary-student's terror related distress in Israel: A quasi-randomized controlled trial, Journal of Traumatic Stress, 20, pp. 541-551, (2007); Bonanno G.A., Brewin C.R., Kaniasty K., La Greca A.M., Weighing the costs of disaster: Consequences, risks, and resilience in individuals, families, and communities, Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 11, pp. 1-49, (2010); Buckle P., Marsh G., Smale S., Assessment of personal and community resilience and vulnerability (Report: EMA Project 15/2000), (2001); Butler L., Morland L., Leskin G., Psychological resilience in the face of terrorism, Psychology of Terrorism, pp. 400-417, (2007); Chemtob C.M., Nakashima J., Carlson J.G., Brief treatment for elementary school children with disaster-related posttraumatic stress disorder: A field study, Journal of Clinical Psychology, 158, pp. 99-112, (2002); Chemtob C.M., Nakashima J.P., Hamada R.S., Psychosocial intervention for postdisaster trauma symptoms in elementary school children: A controlled community field study, Archives of Pediatric Adolescent Medicine, 156, pp. 211-216, (2002); Couto R., Catastrophe and community empowerment: The group formulations of Aberfan's survivors, Journal of Community Psychology, 17, pp. 236-248, (1989); Cutter S.L., Burton C.G., Emrich C.T., Disaster resilience indicators for benchmarking baseline conditions, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, 7, pp. 1-22, (2010); DeWolfe D.J., Field manual for mental health and human service workers in major disasters, (2000); Dirkzwager A.J., Kerssens J.J., Yzermans C.J., Health problems in children and adolescents before and after a man-made disaster, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 45, pp. 94-103, (2006); Doll B., Lyon M.A., Risk and resilience: Implications for the delivery of education and mental health services in schools, School Psychology Review, 27, pp. 348-363, (1998); Eyre A., Public information and support after disasters: a research project, Journal of Public Mental Health, 7, pp. 25-28, (2008); Fitzgerald G., Fitzgerald N., Assessing Community Resilience to Wildfires: Concepts & Approach.

In such a risky society, risk management is absolutely necessary, in particular for modern China as a biggest developing country. This paper firstly discusses the concept of urban resilience whose goal is to shape ""culture of resilience"" to the largest extent to reduce urban risk. Urban resilience includes wide and diverse sides such as engineering, physical, and social-economic dimensions. Secondly, summarizing the legislation system and current programs for Chinese urban resilience, it is found that Chinese central governments are paying more and more attentions to urban resilience through a lot of legislations and programs even if not using the same words. Thirdly and finally, the work to improve urban resilience has to be done step by step, little by little through the efforts of all people by introducing one practice of resilient city planning in Shenzhen city, China. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.","","Developing countries; Intelligent systems; Risk analysis; Risk management; Central government; Current projects; Social-economic; Urban disaster; Urban resilience; Urban risk; Reconstruction (structural)","Beck U., Risk Society, towards a New Modernity, (1992); Colten C.E., Kates R.W., Laska S.B., Three years after katrina: Lessons for community resilience, Environment, 50, 5, pp. 36-47, (2008); Disaster Resilience: A National Imperative, (2012); Cutter S.L., Barnes L., Berry M., Burton C., Evans E., Tate E., Webb J., A place-based model for understanding community resilience to natural disasters, Global Environmental Change, 18, pp. 598-606, (2008); Kahan J.H., Allen A.C., George J.K., An operational framework for resilience, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, 6, 1, (2009); Urban Risk Management in Futian District, Shenzhen City, (2013); The National Plan for Comprehensive Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (2011-2015), (2011); Norris F.H., Stevens S.P., Pfefferbaum B., Wyche K.F., Pfefferbaum R.L., Community resilience as a metaphor, theory, set of capacities, and strategy for disaster readiness, American Journal of Community Psychology, 41, pp. 127-150, (2008); Sherrieb K., Norris F.H., Galea S., Measuring capacities for community resilience, Social Indicators Research, (2010)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887961255"

This especially applies for tasks concerning urban development of existing assets. The optimization of traffic flows, reduction of emissions, improvement of energy efficiency, but also urban climate and landscape planning issues require the involvement of many different actors, balancing different perspectives, and divergent claims. The increasing complexities of planning and decision processes make high demands on professionals of various disciplines, government departments, and municipal decision-makers. In the long term, topics like urban resilience, energy management, risk and resource management have to be taken into account and reflected in future projects, but always related to socio-spatial and governmental aspects. Accordingly, it is important to develop models to be able to understand and analyze the outcomes and effects of governmental measures and planning to the urban environment. Thus, a more systematic approach is needed - going away from well-defined city models to city system models. The purpose is to describe urban processes not only quantitatively, but to grasp their qualitative complexity and interdependencies, by modeling and simulating existing urban systems. This contribution will present the City System Model (CSM) concept closely related to an Urban Energy Planning use case, will highlight the methodology, and focus on first results and findings from an ongoing interdisciplinary research project and use case to improve the basis of information for decision-makers and politicians about urban planning decisions. © 2013 Copernicus.

Subsequently, integrating productivity in cities via landscape and planning tools and developing a sustainable infrastructure become inevitable. This study explores the role of productive landscapes in creating resilient cities. More specifically, the paper focuses on urban agriculture as one of the major components of productive landscapes. Pioneering models of productive landscapes and urban agriculture go back to 19th century with the works of Ebenezer Howard, Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Right, and Ian McHarg. Obviously, cities have been blended with nature for centuries; the only difference now is that industrialization has made food production invisible. Istanbul is presented as the case study. Through the rich history of Istanbul, food has a strong influence on city's image. It is still possible to see the traces of agricultural uses along the Theodesian Walls, and some old neighborhoods. Some foresighted organizations and individuals promote agriculture in inner urban areas. However, dealing with rapid urbanization problems, agricultural lands have been transformed into settlement areas in time. As we are in the age of sustainability, combining agriculture with the new technology and recent architectural trends as well as sustainable master plans incorporating productive landscape concepts will encourage urban agriculture in the city, hence creating more resilient urban environments.","Community development; Productive landscapes; Resilient cities; Social and ecological environments; Urban agriculture","","Akyol M., Evolution of Urban Agriculture Concept and Determination of Criteria, (2011); Bakker N., Growing Cities and Growing Food Problem: Urban Agriculture on the Policy Agenda, (2005); Baser B., Tuncay H.E., Understanding the Spatial and Historical Characteristics of Agricultural Landscapes in Istanbul, ITU A{pipe}Z, 7, 4, (2010); Bohn K., Viljoen A., The Edible City: Envisioning the Continuous Productive Urban Landscape (CPUL)., (2005); Davic R.D., Hartwell H.W., On the Ecological Roles of Salamanders, Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematic, 35, pp. 405-434, (2004); Esbah H., Analyzing Landscape Change through Landscape Structure Indices Case of the City of Aydin, Turkey, Journal of Applied Sciences, 9, 15, pp. 2744-2752, (2009); Frank L., Engelke P., Schmid T., Health and Community Design: The Impact Of The Built Environment On Physical Activity, (2003); Gunderson L., Holling C.S., Pananarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems, (2001); Holling C., Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems, (1973); Jabareen Y., Planning the Resilient City: Concepts and Strategies for Coping with Climate Change and Environmental Risk, (2012); Light A., Urban Ecological Citizenship, Journal of Social Philosophy, 34, 1, pp. 44-63, (2003); Lucey N., The Effect of Sir Ebenezer Howard and the Garden City Movement on Twentieth Century Town Planning, (1973); Mougeot L.J.A., Urban Agriculture: Definition, (2000); Muge Tokus E.S., Akyol M., Esbah H., Demir S., Landscape, ecology and aesthetics: The case of Haliç, (2011); Munn-Venn T., Archibald A., A Resilient Canada: Governance for National Security and Public Safety., (2007); Pickett S.T.A., Cadenasso M.L., Grove J.M., Resilient Cities: Meaning, Models and Metaphor for Integrating the Ecological, Socio-Economic and Planning Realms, pp. 369-384, (2003); Pickett S.T.A., Parker V.T., Fieder P.L., The New Paradigm in Ecology: Implications for Conservation Biology Above the Species Level, Conservation Biology: The Theory and Practice of Nature Conservation, pp. 65-88, (1992); Pierce J.C., Budd W.W., Lovrich N.P., Resilience and Sustainability in US Urban Areas, Environmental Politics, 20, 4, pp. 566-584, (2011); Schnadelbach R.T., Ian McHarg 1920, Fifty Key Thinkers on the Environment, Environment Complete, pp. 228-241, (2000); Smit J., Nasr J., Urban Agriculture for Sustainable Cities: Using Wastes and Idle Land and Water Bodies as Resources, Environment and Urbanization, 4, 12, pp. 141-152, (1992); Steiner F., Healing the Earth: The Relevance of Ian Mcharg's Work for the Future, Philosophy & Geography Academic Search Complete, (2004); Travaline K., Hunold C., Urban Agriculture and Ecological Citizenship in Philadelphia, Local Environment, 15, 6, pp. 581-590, (2010)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84894624119"

The cycle produces simultaneous hot and cold streams at three temperature levels; 60°C for hot water, 40°C for low temperature ambient heating, 10°C for ambient cooling. The cycle has been designed to fulfil the requirements of a flexible 'hybrid' trigeneration scheme, where the three energy streams (electricity, heating and cooling) can be matched closely to the user demands - maximising the Energy Utilisation Factor (EUF) of the fuel. Such a system is likely to be used in environmentally resilient cities in either tertiary sector buildings, interconnected residential zones, industry or other large buildings such as hospitals and educational establishments. The cycle is activated using recuperated thermal energy from a gas turbine exhaust stream and under certain operating conditions uses a small proportion of the electricity produced by the gas turbine generator set. Recuperation is achieved using a direct exhaust gas to R744 recuperating heat exchanger. At higher levels of thermal recuperation, the increase in expander inlet temperature results in a substantial increase in the Coefficient Of Performance (COP). With an expander inlet temperature of 250°C the cycle achieves a COP in cooling of 1.13, whilst with a expander inlet temperature of 350°C the cycle achieves a COP in cooling of 1.58. These values of COP in cooling are typical of double and triple stage absorption chillers respectively. The values for COP in heating are 1.97 for an expander inlet temperature of 250°C, and 2.41 for an expander inlet temperature of 350°C. The cycle is also capable of acting as a power positive bottoming cycle, whilst still providing heating and cooling. Under these circumstances, and assuming an expander inlet temperature of 350°C, the cycle has a thermal to mechanical conversion efficiency of 9.7%. The corresponding values of COP in cooling and heating are 1.03 and 1.80 respectively.

It is clear that diversity plays a pivotal role in the resilience building of ecosystems; however, it is less clear what role cultural diversity plays in the resilience building of urban systems. In this paper we provide innovative insights on how common property systems could contribute to urban resilience building. Through a review of recent findings on urban common property systems and the relevant literature, we deal with urban green commons (UGCs) and discuss their potential to manage cultural and biological diversity in cities. We describe three examples of UGCs, i.e. collectively managed parks, community gardens, and allotment areas, with a focus on their institutional characteristics, their role in promoting diverse learning streams, environmental stewardship, and social-ecological memory. We discuss how UGCs can facilitate cultural integration through civic participation in urban land-management, conditions for the emergence of UGCs, the importance of cognitive resilience building, and what role property-rights diversity plays in urban settings.

However, while sustainability and resilience are increasingly becoming core issues for different strands of scholarship, the strategies for affecting change toward more sustainable and resilient urban centers remain elusive. We use a combination of elements from socio-technical transition theory and political ecology and two Latin American cities (Mexico City and Manizales) to suggest a framework for an analysis of urban transitions in Latin America. The two cities were faced with similar triggers and pressures to create sustainability and resilience and each acted within a time of sweeping international movements. In both cases, networks of actors introduced innovative responses to their own particular set of pressures, constraints and opportunities and attempted to expand nature's life-supporting features such as ecosystem and hydrological services, while reducing threats from hazards such as floods. Yet the innovations that took place in the two cities presented very different results with regard to regime transition. Interestingly, Mexico City's success at creating an urban regime change seems to have been based on the use of a top-down approach as it was driven mainly by actors within the existing power structure with access to the power and the resources of an authoritarian state. By contrast, actors in Manizales have been largely outside the power structure and had less success in creating a city-wide transformation. This highlights the importance of power structure dynamics that can promote or prevent transformations from within or impede transformations from without. © 2013.","","Caldas; Colombia; Federal District [Mexico]; Latin America; Manizales; Mexico [North America]; Mexico City; decision making; resilience; sustainability; top-down approach; urban development","Bai X., Roberts B., Et al., Urban sustainability experiments in Asia: patterns and pathways, Environ Sci Policy, 13, pp. 312-325, (2010); Romero-Lankao P., Qin H., Et al., Vulnerability to temperature-related hazards: a meta-analysis and meta-knowledge approach, Global Environ Change, 22, pp. 670-683, (2012); Kennedy C.A., Ramaswami A., Carney S., Dhakal S., Greenhouse gas emission baselines for global cities and metropolitan regions, Cities Clim Change: Respond Urgent Agenda, (2011); Fischer-Kowalski M., Rotmans J., Conceptualizing, observing and influencing social-ecological transitions, Ecol Soc, 14, (2009); Castan-Broto V., Bulkeley H., A survey of urban climate change experiments in 100 cities, Global Environ Change, 23, pp. 92-102, (2013); Pelling M., Manuel-Navarrete D., From resilience to transformation: the adaptive cycle in two Mexican urban centers, Ecol Soc, 16, (2011); Gallopin G.C., Linkages between vulnerability, resilience and adaptive capacity, Global Environ Change, 16, pp. 293-303, (2006); Turner B.L., Vulnerability and resilience: coalescing or paralleling approaches for sustainability science?, Global Environ Change, 20, pp. 570-576, (2010); Alberti M., Susskind L., Managing urban sustainability: an introduction to the special issue, Environ Impact Assess Rev, 16, pp. 213-221, (1996); Leichenko R., Climate change and urban resilience, Curr Opin Environ Sustain, 3, pp. 164-168, (2011); Garud R., Gehman J., Metatheoretical perspectives on sustainability journeys: evolutionary, relational and durational, Res Policy, 41, pp. 980-995, (2012); (2010); Bulkeley H., Broto V.C., Et al., Cities and Low Carbon Transitions, (2010); Lawhon M., Murphy J.T., Socio-technical regimes and sustainability transitions Insights from political ecology, Progr Human Geogr, 36, pp. 354-378, (2012); Geels F.W., Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case-study, Res Policy, 31, pp. 1257-1274, (2002); Geels F.W., The role of cities in technological transitions: analytical clarifications and historical examples, Cities and Low Carbon Transitions, (2011); Geels F.W., Schot J., Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways, Res Policy, 36, pp. 399-417, (2007); Genus A., Coles A.-M., Rethinking the multi-level perspective of technological transitions, Res Policy, 37, pp. 1436-1445, (2008); Archer M.S., Routine, reflexivity, and realism, Soc Theory, 28, pp. 272-303, (2010); In the Nature of Cities: Urban Political Ecology and the Politics of Urban Metabolism, (2006); Markard J., Raven R., Truffer B., Sustainability transitions: an emerging field of research and its prospects, Res Policy, 41, pp. 955-967, (2012); Manuel-Navarrete D., Pelling M., Redclift M., Critical adaptation to hurricanes in the Mexican Caribbean: development visions, governance structures, and coping strategies, Global Environ Change, 21, pp. 249-258, (2011); Meadowcroft J., What about the politics?

At the same time, human health and security in urban areas are increasingly under threat from extreme water conditions (e.g., floods and droughts) that are projected to become much more frequent with changing climate. One of the major challenge areas for adapting our growing cities to the extreme climatic variations is the sectoral and fragmented approaches through which cities are planned and developed. To a large extent, it seems that the cross-scale linkages are neglected, and the disjuncture between knowledge and action remains a major barrier for genuine progress toward resilient cities. The WASH & RESCUE initiative (WAter, Sanitation and Hygiene in RESilient Cities and Urban areas adapting to Extreme waters) is a response to the above challenges. Funded by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency and implemented by the Stockholm Environment Institute with partners around the world, the research initiative aims to assess risks in urban context with focus on water, sanitation, and human health, developing preventative actions to enhance adaptive capacity through social learning. The project will examine multiple scales - river basin, city, and technical systems - interactions in various social, ecological and cultural contexts through case studies guided by a resilience perspective. The key impact areas targeted by the initiative are 1) understanding risk, with focus on assessment approaches integrating the water, sanitation, hygiene and health aspects; 2) dealing with and reducing risk, with focus on the available preventative measures and actions; and 3) bridging knowledge to action through social learning.","Disaster risk reduction; Health risks; Resilient cities; Social learning; Urban WASH system","Disasters; Health; Risk assessment; Risk management; River basin projects; Sanitation; Assessment approaches; Climatic variation; Disaster risk reductions; Preventative actions; Research initiatives; Resilient cities; Social learning; Urban WASH system; Health risks","Few R., Health and climatic hazards: Framing social research on vulnerability, response and adaptation, Global Environmental Change, 17, pp. 281-295, (2007); Folke C., Carpenter S.R., Walker B., Scheffer M., Chapin T., Rockstrom J., Resilience thinking: Integrating resilience, adaptability and transformability, Ecology and Society, 15, (2010); Global WASH Cluster, Disaster Risk Reduction and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: Comprehensive Guidance, (2011); Parry M.L., Canziani O.F., Palutikof J.P., Van Der Linden P.J., Hanson C.E., Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

It presents the two dominant strategies of mitigation and adaptation, and goes on to present a systems view on the city in which resilience is the key response to climate change. The article argues that resilience depends on three dimensions or areas: a city's physical form, infrastructure and technology, its people and particular multilevel governance, levels of human connectedness and communal self-reliance, and the innovative capacity as well as the level of inclusion of marginalized groups within the economy. Teaching and training is seen as an important element in strengthening resilience, and the article presents a number of case studies showing the relevance of learning processes as conditions to work successfully in urban networks in the areas mentioned. The article takes organizational learning as its main orientation and presents important concepts such as ""reflective action"", ""learning by doing"", ""mental maps"", the ""experiential learning cycle"" and the ""5 disciplines of the learning organization"". This forms the base for the design of concrete educational material. This material is centered on a number of eco-cultural innovations: concrete ideas, technologies, systems or activities that focus on neighborhood-based activities that reinforce the local economy or introduce small-scale technology for water, renewable energy or waste. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Urbanization is also a complex dynamic process playing out over multiple scales of space and ime. Virtually all of the world's future population growth is predicted to take place in cities and their urban landscapes - the UN estimates a global increase from the current 2.9 billion urban residents to a staggering 5.0 billion by 2030. Local resiliency with regard to disasters means that a locale is able to withstand an extreme natural event without suffering devastating losses, damage, diminished productivity, or quality of life and without a large amount of assistance from outside the community. Resilience is defined as ""the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and re-organize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity and feedbacks"". Vulnerability is the flip side of resilience: when a social or ecological system loses resilience it becomes vulnerable to change that previously could be absorbed, For resilience, we need to start not with what's missing but whit what's already there. At this article is tried to determine different conceptual models and frameworks of resilient communities. We also compare these models and frameworks and consider their components and dimensions, Then, we consider social and cultural dimensions and components of resilience in these models and then define proper dimension of social and cultural resiliencein Islamic Cities.","Disaster management; Islamic cities; Resilient cities; Urban areas; Vulnerability","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Population statistics; Risk management; Disaster management; Islamic cities; Resilient cities; Urban areas; Vulnerability; Urban growth","Adger W.N., Et al., Social-ecological Resilience Tocoastal Disasters, (2005); ADPC, CBDRM Field Practitioners' Handbook, (2004); Jorn B., Indicators and criteria, Measuring Vulnerability to Natural Hazards: Towards Disaster Resilient Societies, (2006); Bolin R., Stanford L., The Northridge Earthquake: Vulnerability and Disaster, (1998); Borden K., Schmidtlein M.C., Emrich C., Piegorsch W.P., Cutter S.L., Vulnerability of US cities to environmental hazards, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management 4, (2007); Bruneau M., Chang S.E., Eguchi R.T., Lee G.C., O'Rourke T.D., Remhorn A.M., Shmozuka M., Tierney K.T., Wallace W.A., Von Wmterfeldt D., A framework to quantitatively assess and enhance the seismic resilience of communities, Earthquake Spectra, 19, 4, pp. 733-752, (2003); Burby R.J., Deyle R.E., Godschalk D.R., Olshansky R.B., Creating hazard resilient communities through land-use planning, Natural Hazards Review, 2, 1, pp. 99-106, (2000); CED, The Community Resilience Manual: A Resource for Rural Recovery and Renewal, (2000); Comfort L.K., Shared Risk: Complex Systems in Seismic Response, (1999); A Resilience Alliance Initiative for Transitioning Urban Systems Towards Sustainable Futures, (2007); Cutter S.L., Barnes L., Berry M., Burton C., Evans E., Tate E., Webb J., Community and regional resilience: Perspectives from hazards, disasters, and emergency management, CARRI Research Reportl, (2008); Cutter S.L., Boruff B.J., Shirley W.L., Social vulnerability to environmental hazards, Social Science Quarterly, 84, 1, pp. 242-261, (2003); Institutional Assessment and Capacity Development; Why, What and How, Tools and Methods Series, (2007); Folke C., Resilience: The emergence of a perspective for socialecological systems analyses, Global Environmental Change, (2006); Folke C., Carpenter S., Elmqvist T., Gunderson L., Holling C.S., Walker B., Resilience and sustainable development: Building adaptive capacity in a world of transformations, Ambio, 31, 5, pp. 437-440, (2002); Foster H.D., The Ozymandias Principles: Thirty-one Strategies for Surviving Change, (1997); Gallopin G.C., Linkages between vulnerability, Resilience and Adaptive, (2006); Godschalk D.R., Urban hazard mitigation: Creating resilient cities, Natural Hazards Review, 4, 3, pp. 136-143, (2003); Harnson P., Pearce F., AAAS Atlas of Population and Environment, (2000); Henestra D., Kovacs P., McBean G., Sweeting R., Background Paper on Disaster Resilient Cities, (2004); Holling C.S., Resilience and stability of ecological systems, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 4, pp. 1-23, (1973); IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), Technical summary: Climate change 2001: Impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability, A Report of Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2001); King D., MacGregor C., Using social indicators to measure community vulnerability to natural hazards, Australian Journal of Emergency Management, 15, 3, pp. 52-57, (2000); Klein R.J.N., Thomalla F., Resilience to natural hazards: How useful is this concept?, Environmental Hazards, (2003); McEntire D.A., Fuller C., Weber R., A comparison of disaster paradigm: The search for a holistic policy, Public Administration Review, (2002); Miller J.G., Living Systems, (1978); Moe E.O., Consulting with a community system, Journal at Social Issues, 15, pp. 29-35, (1960); Moor J., Cities at risk, Habitat Debate, 7, 4, pp. 1-6, (2001); NOAA, Coastal Services Center, Summary of the NOAA Three Community Resilience Salons, (2007); Olshansky R.B., Kartez J.D., Managing land use to build resilience, Cooperating with Nature: Confronting Natural Hazards with Land use Planning for Sustainable Communities, (1998); Peiling M., The Vulnerability of Cities: Natural Disasters and Social Resilience, (2003); Tierney K.J., Lindell M.K., Perry R.W., Facing the Unexpected: Disaster Preparedness and Response in the United States, Natural Hazards and Disasters, (2001); UNPD, Capacity assessment and development in a systems and strategic management content, Technical Advisory Paper No. 3, (1998); Vale L.J., Campanella T.J., The Resilient City: Trauma, Recovery, and Remembrance, (2002)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925002782"

Although market forces and private interests have historically controlled the decision-making process, land-use regulations have been used to counter market failures and to collectively guide the growth of the American city. During the second half of the nineteenth century, advancements in construction and building technologies, including the steel structural frame, internal pneumatic and telegraphic communications, efficient mechanical systems, and improved fireproofing materials and techniques, allowed for the construction of structures of increasing height. As tall building construction flourished in major U.S. cities, issues of light, ventilation, and public health, as well as encroachment of incompatible uses, began to capture the public's attention. Where tenement reform laws had addressed residential overcrowding, owners, architects, and public officials viewed building regulations as a means to minimize the negative impacts of increasingly massive structures on surrounding property values and public space. This article discusses the evolution of zoning and its implications for the form of cities and suburbs by tracing the history of New York's first comprehensive zoning law. It first presents the economic, social, and technological forces leading to calls for regulation of the built environment and then examines the passage of the 1916 Zoning Resolution as it related to issues of public health, separation of uses, and real estate economics. Finally, the article explores the effect of zoning on the growth of the New York region, focusing on its impact on urban form and the spatial patterns of development and its relationship to emerging issues of environmental sustainability and urban resilience. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Land use; Regulation; Tall buildings; Technology; Zoning","Building codes; Commerce; Economics; Fireproofing; Land use; Laws and legislation; Public health; Tall buildings; Technology; Urban growth; Building construction; Building regulations; Building technologies; Decision making process; Environmental sustainability; Massive structures; Mechanical systems; Regulation; Zoning","Al-Kodmany K., Tall buildings, design, and technology: Visions for the twenty-first century city, J.

To quantify the urban metabolism, we use the ""emergy"" assessment method (all materials and energy are transformed to solar energy equivalents) and then present a group of urban metabolic indicators, which quantify urban metabolic balance, capacity, and outputs to assess a city's metabolic efficiencies. In this paper, we use 31 Chinese cities as a sample to illustrate how the model can be operated to evaluate the urban metabolism by emergy analysis. Our results indicate that metropolises and coastal cities were more metabolically efficient with higher metabolic balance, capacities, and outputs; but with more external dependency on imported resources. Central and western cities had lower metabolic efficiencies, with a high ratio of non-renewable emergy reliance. Policy implications highlight the need for renewable energy sources and improved management of imported services, goods, and fuels to achieve higher urban resilience and sustainability.","""emergy"" theory; Chinese cities; Urban metabolism; Urban metabolism model; Urban sustainable development","article; energy resource; metabolic parameters; policy; renewable energy; social environment; solar energy; urban area","Wolman A., The metabolism of cities, Scientific American, 213, pp. 179-190, (1965); Newman P.W.G., Sustainability and cities: Extending the metabolism model, Landscape and Urban Planning, 44, pp. 219-226, (1999); Zhang Y., Yang Z.F., Yu X.Y., Ecological network and emergy analysis of urban metabolic systems: Model development, and a case study of four Chinese cities, Ecol.

The resultant flooding demonstrates that the management of flood risk must incorporate new concepts like urban resilience in the city's planning process. The goal is to assess if resilience have been incorporated into the recovery of New Orleans post-Katrina, particularly of one city neighborhood: Oak Park. The assessment of Oak Park's urban resilience was made by comparing its pre and post Katrina conditions. A methodology was developed for modeling failure mechanisms by using two operational safety methods: a functional analysis and a failure mode and effect analysis. In New Orleans' post-Katrina recovery, a strong emphasis has been placed on improving the flood performance of buildings and protective systems but other components and vital functions of the neighborhood have not been fully considered. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.","","Risk management; Failure mode and effect analysis; Flood risks; Hurricane katrina; Katrina; Man-made disasters; Modeling failures; Natural disasters; New Orleans; Operational safety; Performance of buildings; Planning process; Protective systems; Urban resilience; Floods","Beacon of Hope, Resource Center, (2011); Bonnefous C., Courtois A., Indicateurs de performance, Paris: Editions HERMES Science Publication, (2001); Campanella T.J., Urban resilience and the recovery of new orleans.

Neighbourhood or 'place' is an important factor in deciding social and economic outcomes. Neighbourhood is also increasingly important for urban planning across Europe as communities are at the front-line in developing resilience to anthropogenic and natural shocks. The current financial crisis and public sector austerity measures across Europe represent shocks to local communities that require policymakers to maximize investments and resources delivered to local communities. Communities and citizens can therefore play a bigger role in contributing to the resilience of cities through local neighbourhood planning. However, there is a need to work differently as public and private finances are restricted and communities need to co-produce plans and delivery of services. Co-production can therefore be one contribution to solutions designed to foster resilience and deliver efficient neighbourhood planning and associated services. Coproduction in this context requires an open source approach in which producers and consumers can observe viewpoints and react to the implications of simulated outcomes. Whilst there are numerous examples of Planning Support Systems (PSS) designed to assist urban planners there has been no significant progress made in developing a 'grounded' approach incorporating 'real-time' inputs from users and stakeholders at the neighbourhood level. This paper sets out the principles and objectives of a simulation-based OpenPlan system in which producers and consumers swap roles. This leads to a greater coproduction of planning inputs designed to deliver optimal outcomes and more resilient cities. © 2012 IEEE.","","Optimization; Agent-based modelling; Co-production; Financial crisis; Local community; Neighbourhood; Open sources; Optimal planning; Planning support systems; Policy makers; Private finance; Public sector; Spatial planning; Urban planners; Urban planning","Adger W.N., Social and ecological resilience: Are they related?, Progress in Human Geography, 24, 3, pp. 347-364, (2000); Ballas D., Kingston R., Stillwell J.C.H., Jin J., Building a spatial microsimulation-based planning support system for local policy making, Environment and Planning A, 39, 10, pp. 2482-2499, (2007); Batty M., Cities and Complexity: Understanding Cities with Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Models, and Fractals, (2005); Brail R.K., Klosterman R.E., Planning Support Systems; Integrating Geographic Information Systems, Models and Visualisation Tools, (2001); Brail R.K., Planning Support Systems for Cities and Regions, (2008); Brabham D.C., Crowdsourcing as a model for problem solving, Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies, 14, 1, pp. 75-90, (2008); Brower S., The sectors of the transect, Journal of Urban Design, 7, 3, pp. 313-320, (2002); Participation and Policy Integration in Spatial Planning: Spatial Plans in Practice: Supporting the Reform of Local Planning, (2008); National Planning Policy Framework, (2008); Coaffee J., Murkami-Wood D., Rogers P., The Everyday Resilience of the City, (2008); Edwards C., Resilient Nation, (2009); Etzioni A., Remp R., Technological Shortcuts to Social Change, (1973); Human Computer Confluence Consultation Workshop Report, (2007); Field B.G., MacGregor B.D., Forecasting Techniques for Urban and Regional Planning, (1987); Fitzpatrick S., Poverty of Place, (2004); Haller C., Crowdsourcing Platform Enables Citizens to Document Crisis Information, (2012); Healey P., Network complexity and the imaginative power of strategic spatial planning, The Network Society: A New Context for Planning, pp. 146-160, (2005); Kearns A., Parkinson M., The significance of neighbourhood, Urban Studies, 38, 12, pp. 2103-2110, (2001); Kingston R.P., Public participation in local policy decision-making: The role of Web-based mapping, Cartographic Journal, 44, 2, pp. 138-144, (2007); Peach C., Good segregation, bad segregation, Planning Perspectives, 11, pp. 379-398, (1996); Petts J., Leach B., Evaluating Methods for Public Participation: Literature Review, (2001); Rose A., Economic resilience to natural and man-made disasters: Multidisciplinary origins and contextual dimensions, Environmental Hazards, 7, 4, pp. 383-398, (2007); Schelling T., Dynamic models of segregation, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 1, pp. 143-186, (1971); Skeffington A., Report of the Committee on Public Participation in Planning, (1969); Slatter P., Looking Sideways: A Community Asset Approach to Coproduction of Neighbourhoods and Neighbourhood Services in Birmingham, (2010); Theodoropoulos G., Catriona K., Lee P., Skelcher C., Ferrari E., Sorge V., AIMSS: Data driven simulations in the social sciences, Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems, (2011); Theodoropoulos G., Minson R., Ewald R., Lees M., Simulation engines for multi-agent systems, Multi-Agent Systems: Simulation and Applications, pp. 77-108, (2009); Trickett L., Lee P., Leadership of 'subregional' places in the context of growth, Policy Studies, 31, 4, pp. 429-440, (2010); Vanegas C.A., Aliaga D.G., Wonka P., Muller P., Waddell P., Watson B., Modeling the appearance and behavior of urban spaces, Computer Graphics Forum, 28, 2, pp. 1-18, (2009); Vanegas C.A., Aliaga D., Benes B., Waddell P., Visualization of simulated urban spaces: Inferring parameterized generation of streets, parcels, and aerial imagery, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 15, 3, pp. 424-435, (2009)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874712206"

Furthermore, most studies on the subject make use of general, vague, and confusing terminology. This paper suggests a new innovative conceptual framework (the Resilient City Planning Framework or RCPF) that addresses the critical question of what cities and their urban communities should do in order to move towards a more resilient state in the future. Accordingly, the RCPF takes complexity and uncertainty into account. It is affected by a multiplicity of economic, social, spatial, and physical factors and its planning involves a wide range of stakeholders. RCPF is a network of four interlinked concepts that together, provide a comprehensive understanding of City Resilience. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Environmental risks; Planning; Urban resilience","climate change; conceptual framework; coping strategy; environmental risk; stakeholder; strategic approach; urban planning; urban society","Abbate C., A vicious circle, pp. 129-134, (2008); Abbott J., Planning for complex metropolitan regions: A better future or a more certain one?, Journal of Planning Education and Research, 28, pp. 503-517, (2009); Adger W.N., Social and ecological resilience.

The resilience of a system is defined as the ability to absorb a disturbance and then recover its functions. Applied to the technical networks, the concept of resilience enables an integrated approach from the conception to the management. Taking into account possible disruptions, planning for the continuity of the service and tackling critical points involve many stakeholders who must collaborate to ensure the sustainability of the system. We are currently developing a method to raise awareness of network managers and local authorities in the relevance of improving resilience. It is based on an auto-diagnosis made to highlight (1) interdependencies between systems: water, power, but also telecommunications or transports and (2) the effects of the disruption of one or more systems on the others. The portrait of the system leads the managers to think about possible disturbances, impacts on the system, counter-measures and adaptability. Then all actors are gathered for a collaborative session where they can discuss their interdependencies: which system is dependent on which system? Which resources are necessary to the systems operating? Are the managers taking these dependencies into account? Could they plan for a better management of those networks? This tool is tested with the City of Paris in order to assess the resilience of technical networks in the perspective of the ""100 year"" floods, so that Paris can be more resilient and sustainable.","Auto-diagnosis; Interdependencies; Technical network; Urban resilience","Climate change; Management; Managers; Auto-diagnosis; Collaborative approach; Collaborative sessions; Critical points; Integrated approach; Interdependencies; Local authorities; Natural hazard; Network managers; Resilient networks; Technical networks; Urban resilience; Urban planning","Brand F.S., Jax K., Focusing on the Meaning(s) of Resilience: Resilience as a Descriptive Concept and a Boundary Object, 12, 1, (2007); Bruneau M., Chang S.E., Et al., A framework to quantitatively assess and enhance the seismic resilience of communities, Earthquake Spectra, 19, 4, pp. 733-752, (2003); Comfort L.K., Boin A., Et al., Designing Resilience : Preparing for Extreme Events, (2010); Cutter S.L., Barnes L., Et al., A place-based model for understanding community resilience to natural disasters, Global Environmental Change, 18, 4, pp. 598-606, (2008); Godschalk D.R., Urban hazard mitigation: Creating resilient cities, Natural Hazards Review, 4, 3, pp. 136-143, (2003); Lhomme S., Serre D., Et al., A methodology to produce interdependent networks disturbance scenarios, International Conference on Vulnerability and Risk Analysis and Management, (2011); Lhomme S., Toubin M., Et al., From technical resilience toward urban services resilience, Fourth Resilience Engineering Symposium, pp. 172-178, (2011); Mayunga J.S., Understanding and applying the concept of community disaster resilience: A capital-based approach, Summer Academy for Social Vulnerability and Resilience Building, (2007); Ridder D., Mostert E., Et al., Learning Together to Manage Together- Improving Participation in Water Management, (2005); Robert B., Pinel W., Et al., Organizational Resilience- Concepts and Evaluation Method, (2009); Roe E., Terms, Definitions and Concepts Related to Critical Infrastructures, Chokepoints & Services, (2010); Serre D., La ville résiliente aux inondations, méthodes et outils d'évaluation, Université Paris-Est, Mémoire D'Habilitation à Diriger les Recherches, (2011); Toubin M., Au auto-diagnosis tool to improve urban resilience: The RATP case study, International Conference ""How the Concept of Resilience is Able to Improve Urban Risk Management? a Temporal and a Spatial Analysis, (2011)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862005635"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on James Scott's notion of ""legibility"" to ask how different representations simplify complex realities and how they are transformed into plans and programs. The paper first outlines the various broad analytic lens used to examine legibility to portray post-disaster reconstruction, drawing on international literature and policies. The paper then focuses on post-earthquake Haiti and analyzes eight reconstruction plans and reviews design proposals submitted for the Building Back Better Communities program to explore how different stakeholders portrayed the disaster, identified the reconstruction challenges and proposed to address human settlements. Findings: Representations of the disaster, the reconstruction challenge and the housing problem were quite varied. While the plans assumed a very broad view of the reconstruction challenge (one that goes beyond the representations found in the literature), the BBBC program adopted a very narrow view of it (one that the literature condemns for failing to achieve sustainable resilience). Research limitations/implications: The empirical research is exploratory, suggesting an approach that throws a new light on the analysis of plans and programs for improved resilience. Practical implications: The study suggests that the representations that decision makers, institutions and organizations make of the world ultimately establish the framework in which resilience is constructed.

Cities are responsible for the largest component of global energy, water, and food consumption as well as related sewage and organic waste production. Due to ongoing global urbanization, in which the largest sector of the global population lives in cities which are already built, global level strategies need to be developed that facilitate both the sustainable construction of new cities and the re-development of existing urban environments. A very promising approach in this regard is the decentralization and building integration of environmentally sound infrastructure systems for integrated resource management. This paper discusses such new and innovative building services engineering systems, which could contribute to increased energy efficiency, resource productivity, and urban resilience. Applied research and development projects in Germany, which are based on integrated system approaches for the integrated and environmentally sound management of energy, water and organic waste, are used as examples. The findings are especially promising and can be used to stimulate further research and development, including economical aspects which are crucial for sustainable urban (re-)development. © 2013 by the authors.","Building integration; Decentralized infrastructure; Energy; Integrated resource management OPEN ACCESS; Organic waste; Sustainability; Water","Germany; decentralization; energy efficiency; energy planning; infrastructural development; integrated approach; research and development; resource management; sustainable development; urban development; urban planning; waste management; water management","Buildings and Climate Change Summary for Decision-Makers, (2009); United Nations, D.o.E.a.S.A.

Urban resilience is then based on urban services which support the cities functions and yet, display several critical issues in risk management. When considered as socio-technical systems in which physical network and governance are interacting, urban services are subject to continuity issues, mainly because of interdependencies. We propose here a collaborative method to help managers identify both technical and organizational dependencies so that they can share a common representation of the urban system and discuss its global resilience. The Parisian transportation system (RATP) illustrates the first part of the method: the auto-diagnosis tool to identify and prioritize dependencies. Then the rest of the method is shortly described and we outline the interest of the research in improving urban resilience. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.","","Urban growth; Continuity issues; Critical issues; Physical network; Sociotechnical systems; Transportation system; Urban development; Urban resilience; Urban systems; Risk management","Bruneau M., Et al., A framework to quantitatively assess and enhance the seismic resilience of communities, Earthquake Spectra, 19, 4, pp. 733-752, (2003); Comfort L.K., Boin A., Demchak C.C., Designing Resilience: Preparing for Extreme Events, (2010); Folke C., Et al., Resilience and sustainable development: Building adaptive capacity in a world of transformations, World Summit on Sustainable Development on Behalf of the Environmental Advisory Council to the Swedish Government, (2002); Godschalk D.R., Urban hazard mitigation: Creating resilient cities, Natural Hazards Review, 4, 3, (2003); Holling C.S., Resilience and stability of ecological systems, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 4, (1973); Lhomme S., Serre D., Et al., A methodology to produce interdependent networks disturbance scenarios, International Conference on Vulnerability and Risk Analysis and Management, (2011); Lhomme S., Toubin M., Et al., From technical resilience toward urban services resilience, Fourth Resilience Engineering Symposium.

Simulating such a complex scenario requires modeling the population and its interactions with interdependent infrastructures such as transportation, communications, and healthcare. Our work represents the first model of a behaving human population, resolved to the individual level, where agents make decisions based on their health state, environmental conditions, and (informational) awareness. This 'big simulation' approach requires a large amount of carefully curated data at the input, which is combined into a 'synthetic information' model. The simulation is database-driven in a novel architecture that enables scaling, and it produces large amounts of data that in turn require advanced analytics in order to extract policy-relevant conclusions. We present results from a spatio-temporal analysis that draw out the connections between spatial variations in population behaviors and health outcomes. © 2013 IEEE.","Analytics; Big Data; Big Simulation; Disaster Modeling; Synthetic Information; Urban Resilience","Disasters; Analytics; Big datum; Big Simulation; Synthetic Information; Urban resilience; Computer simulation","Bos, Et al., Planning guidance for response to a nuclear detonation, National Security Staff, Interagency Policy Subcoordination Committee for Preparedness and Response to Radiological and Nuclear Threats, (2010); Buddemeier B.R., Valentine J.E., Millage K.K., Brandt L.D., National Capital Region: Key Response Planning Factors for the Aftermath of Nuclear Terrorism, (2011); Wein L.M., Choi Y., Denuit S., Analyzing evacuation versus shelter-in-place strategies after a terrorist nuclear detonation, Risk Analysis, 30, 9, pp. 1315-1327, (2010); Collier N., North M., Repast HPC: A platform for large-scale agent-based modeling, Large-Scale Computing Techniques for Complex System Simulations, pp. 81-110, (2011); North M.J., Collier N.T., Ozik J., Tatara E.R., Macal C.M., Bragen M., Sydelko P., Complex adaptive systems modeling with repast simphony, Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling, 1, 1, (2013); Heber G., Gray J., Supporting Finite Element Analysis with A Relational Database Backend, Part II: Database Design and Access, (2007); Heber G., Gray J., Supporting finite element analysis with a relational database backend, part i: There is life beyond files, Arxiv Preprint Cs.DB, (2007); White W., Demers A., Koch C., Gehrke J., Rajagopalan R., Scaling games to epic proportions, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, (2007); Barrett C., Beckman R., Berkbigler K., Bisset K., Bush B., Campbell K., Eubank S., Henson K., Hurford J., Kubicek D., Marathe M., Romero P., Smith J., Smith L., Speckman P., Stretz P., Thayer G., Eeckhout E., Williams M.D., TRANSIMS: Transportation Analysis Simulation System, (2001); Beckman R.J., Baggerly K.A., McKay M.D., Creating synthetic base-line populations, Transportation Research A-Policy and Practice, 30, pp. 415-429, (1996); Parikh N., Shirole S., Swarup S., Modeling the effects of transient populations on epidemics, The AAAI Fall Symposium on Social Networks and Social Contagion, (2012); Adiga A., Mortveit H.S., Wu S., Route stability in large-scale transportation systems, The Workshop on Multiagent Interaction Networks (MAIN), Held in Conjunction with AAMAS 2013, (2013); Chandan S., Saha S., Barrett C., Eubank S., Marathe A., Marathe M., Swarup S., Vullikanti A.K., Modeling the interactions between emergency communications and behavior in the aftermath of a disaster, The International Conference on Social Computing, Behavioral-Cultural Modeling, and Prediction (SBP), (2013); Lewis B., Swarup S., Bisset K., Eubank S., Marathe M., Barrett C., A simulation environment for the dynamic evaluation of disaster preparedness policies, The Journal of Public Health Management and Practice, 19, (2013); Sutton R., Precup D., Singh S., Between MDPs and semi-MDPs: A framework for temporal abstraction in reinforcement learning, Artificial Intelligence, 112, 1-2, pp. 181-211, (1999); Guterbock T.M., Lambert J.H., Bebel R.A., Ellis J.M., Kermer D.A., Population Behaviors in Dirty Bomb Attack Scenarios: A Survey of the National Capital Region, (2010); Lasker R.D., Redefining Readiness: Terrorism Planning Through the Eyes of the Public, (2004); Lasker R.D., Hunter N.D., Francis S.E., With the Public's Knowledge, We Can Make Sheltering in Place Possible, (2007); Parikh N., Swarup S., Stretz P.E., Rivers C.M., Lewis B.L., Marathe M.V., Eubank S.G., Barrett C.L., Lum K., Chungbaek Y., Modeling human behavior in the aftermath of a hypothetical improvised nuclear detonation, Proceedings of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), (2013); Gray J., Reuter A., Transaction Processing, (1993); Barrett C., Bisset K., Chandan S., Chen J., Chungbaek Y., Eubank S., Evrenosoglu Y., Lewis B., Lum K., Marathe A., Marathe M., Mortveit H., Parikh N., Phadke A., Reed J., Rivers C., Saha S., Stretz P., Swarup S., Thorp J., Vullikanti A., Xie D., Planning and response in the aftermath of a large crisis: An agent-based informatics framework, Proceedings of the 2013 Winter Simulation Conference, (2013); Koenker R., Bassett G., Regression quantiles, Econometrica, 46, 1, pp. 33-50, (1978); Koenker R., Quantreg: Quantile Regression, (2009); R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, (2013); Lum K., Gelfand A.E., Spatial quantile multiple regression using the asymmetric laplace process, Bayesian Analysis, 7, 2, pp. 235-258, (2012); Robinson A., Levis J., Bennett G., INFORMS to officially join analytics movement, ORMS Today, 37, 5, (2010); Haas P.J., Maglio P.P., Selinger P.G., Tan W.-C., Data is dead.

African cities already face huge demands with regard to human health and urban sustainability, and global environmental change will increase these challenges, making it even more imperative that human health and urban sustainability are simultaneously addressed in locally appropriate ways. Key areas of intersection include increased temperatures, drought, flooding, the decreased ability of ecosystems to provide health-enhancing services (clean air, water and soil) and increasing urban food insecurity. There are a range of strategies that can be used to improve urban resilience and sustainability while simultaneously improving human health.

Traditional approaches are unsuited to address future challenges like climate change and modern urban development trends (e. g. migration, aging population, densification). As well as increased risks of water scarcity and flooding, society's demands for urban amenity and healthy waterways in metropolitan areas also challenge these traditional principles of urban water management. It is increasingly recognized that solutions to these challenges will not be purely technological in nature; the socio-institutional contexts will also be critical. However modelling tools to support medium and long-term strategic planning of integrated social and infrastructural dimensions are lacking, leaving decision-makers with untested policy ideas. To identify possible transition strategies to a resilient city, the development of the DAnCE4Water (Dynamic Adaptation for eNabling City Evolution for Water) within the EU FP7 project ""PREPARED: Enabling Change"" as a strategic planning and decision-support tool is thus proposed. DAnCE4Water allows 'What-if' experiments by investigating possible consequences of policies and strategic actions, taking into consideration urban development, climate change, biophysical environment and societal dynamics. This paper presents the concept of the DAnCE4Water tool and its application to an example city's evolution 20 years into the future. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.","","climate change; decision making; decision support system; drinking water; flood control; metropolitan area; sanitation; strategic approach; urbanization; water management; waterfront development; waterway transport","Hydraulische Bemessung und Nachweis von Entwässerungssystemen, (2006); Arnbjerg-Nielsen K., Quantification of climate change effects on extreme precipitation used for high resolution hydrologic design, Urban Water Journal, pp. 1-9, (2012); Ashley R.M., Balmforth D.J., Saul A.J., Blanskby J.D., Flooding in the future: predicting climate change, risks and responses in urban areas, Water Science & Technology, 52, 5, pp. 265-273, (2005); Bach P.M., Hellbach C., Urich C., McCarthy D.T., Sitzenfrei R., Kleidorfer M., Rauch W., Deletic A., Characterising a city for integrated performance assessment of water infrastructure in the DAnCE4Water framework, (2011); Brown R.R., Keath N., Wong T.H.F., Urban water management in cities: historical, current and future regimes, Water Science & Technology, 59, 5, pp. 847-855, (2009); de Haan J., Ferguson B., Brown R., Deletic A., A Workbench for Societal Transitions in Water Sensitive Cities, (2011); Bemessung von Regenrückhalteräumen, (2006); Kleidorfer M., Moderl M., Sitzenfrei R., Urich C., Rauch W., A case independent approach on the impact of climate change effects on combined sewer system performance, Water Science and Technology, 60, 6, pp. 1555-1564, (2009); Kleidorfer M., Rauch W., An application of Austrian legal requirements for CSO emissions, Water Science and Technology, 64, 5, pp. 1081-1088, (2011); Moderl M., Kleidorfer M., Sitzenfrei R., Rauch W., Identifying weak points of urban drainage systems by means of VulNetUD, Water Science and Technology, 60, 10, pp. 2507-2513, (2009); Kleinräumige Bevölkerungsprognose für Österreich 2010-2030 mit Ausblick bis 2050, (2010); Patterson Z., Bierlaire M., Development of prototype UrbanSim models, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 37, 2, pp. 344-366, (2010); Rossman L.A., Storm water management model - User's manual Version 5.0, (2004); Semadeni-Davies A., Hernebring C., Svensson G., Gustafsson L.-G., The impacts of climate change and urbanisation on drainage in Helsingborg, Sweden: Combined sewer system, Journal of Hydrology, 350, 1-2, pp. 100-113, (2008); Sitzenfrei R., Fach S., Kinzel H., Rauch W., A multi-layer cellular automata approach for algorithmic generation of virtual case studies: VIBe, Water Science and Technology, 61, 1, pp. 37-45, (2010); Urich C., Burger G., Mair M., Rauch W., DynaMind - A Softwaretool for Integrated Modelling of Urban Environments and their Infrastructure, 10th International Conference on Hydroinformatics, (2012); Urich C., Sitzenfrei R., Moderl M., Rauch W., An agent based approach for generating virtual sewer systems, Water Science and Technology, 62, 5, pp. 1090-1097, (2010); Urich C., Bach P.M., Hellbach C., Sitzenfrei R., Kleidorfer M., McCarthy D.T., Deletic A., Dynamics of cities and water infrastructure in the DAnCE4Water model, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Urban Drainage, (2011); Waddell P., UrbanSim: Modeling urban development for land use, transportation, and environmental planning, Journal of the American Planning Association, 68, 3, pp. 297-314, (2002)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876086711"

These circumstances require the management of flood risk by integrating new concepts like urban resilience. Nevertheless, urban resilience seems to have no accurate meanings. That is why researchers are primarily concerned with defining resilience. Nevertheless, focus on research object seems to be more important than focus on conceptual debate (Resilience of what? Rather than what is resilience?). Thus the methodology designed here is focused on urban considerations. In fact, a system approach emphasizes technical networks' importance concerning urban resilience. Principles and assumptions applied in this research finally lead to the analysis of how urban networks are able to face natural hazards. In this context, a Web-GIS has been developed for analyzing resistance capacity, absorption capacity and recovery capacity of different technical networks. A first application has been carried out on a French agglomeration in order to analyze road network absorption capacity. This application is very specific but, thanks to this example, it is already possible to highlight the methodology's usefulness. © Author(s) 2013.","","Europe; agglomeration; conceptual framework; flooding; GIS; risk assessment; satellite data; urban planning","Albert R., Albert I., Nakarado G., Structural vulnerability of the North American power grid, Phys.

Residents understood and respected the natural limitations of the city. However, in the late 1900s, with the introduction of drainage pumps, outfall canals and equipment stations, New Orleans envisioned a city no longer constrained by either geography or tradition. Below-sea-level areas were drained and became footprints for new neighborhoods. After 1965's Hurricane Betsy, the Corps of Engineers undertook a series of construction projects throughout the New Orleans region to protect from future hurricanes. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina proved the city's storm protection system unfit to handle natural disasters, when eighty percent of New Orleans flooded. Consequently, government leaders, citizens, professionals and academic advisors have worked to achieve enhanced urban resiliency through recovery projects. New Orleans has embarked on its post-disaster journey by rethinking and reimagining the city and its neighborhoods for the betterment of all its citizens in an era of strengthening hurricanes, rising sea levels and climate change. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.","","Climate change; Disasters; Floods; Hurricanes; Construction projects; Corps of Engineers; Drainage pumps; Hurricane katrina; Katrina; Living spaces; Neighbourhood; New Orleans; Storm protection; Urban resilience; Sea level","Augustine J., Regional Transit Authority Transportation Investments Generate Economic Growth, (2012); Jatres D., Regional Planning Commission, (2012); Herbert B., From Anna to Britney to Zawahri, (2007); Hurricane Katrina Anniversary Data for Louisiana, (2006); McWhirter C., Dougherty C., A tech buildup on the bayou, The Wall Street Journal, (2012); News from the Docks, 13, 6, (2012)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867386546"

First, we classify and categorize important ecosystem services and disservices in urban areas. Second, we describe a range of valuation approaches (cultural values, health benefi ts, economic costs, and resilience) for capturing the importance of urban ecosystem service multiple values. Finally, we analyze how ecosystem service assessment may inform urban planning and governance and provide practical examples from cities in Africa, Europe, and America. From our review, we fi nd that many urban ecosystem services have already been identifi ed, characterized and valued, and have been found to be of great value and importance for human well-being and urban resilience. We conclude that the use of the concept of urban ecosystem services can play a critical role in reconnecting cities to the biosphere, and reducing the ecological footprint and ecological debt of cities while enhancing resilience, health, and quality of life of their inhabitants. © 2013, Springer Netherlands.

Immigrants' settlement in postindustrial cities with competitive housing and labour markets has been explored with spatial, economic, and social theories, particularly in disciplines such as geography and urban planning. However, there is a great potential for community resilience theories from the disciplines of ecology and psychology to provide a richer understanding of the choices of specific ethnocultural groups. This article introduces the literature on immigrants' housing and neighbourhood choices in Canadian cities, citing theories of spatial assimilation, housing career and structural change. These theories have contributed to researchers' understanding of how immigrants' patterns differ from those of non-immigrants. However, theories of community resilience provide a lens through which to view differences within the immigrant population. Using the definitions of simple resilience and psychological resilience, this article aims to view immigrants' housing choices through a new lens, and gives a different perspective to ethnocultural differences in housing patterns.© Licence Creative Commons.","Community resilience; Housing; Immigration; Neighbourhoods; Resilient cities","","Agrawal S.K., Qadeer M.A., Faith-based Ethnic Residential Communities and Neighbourliness, (2008); Balakrishnan T.R., Hou F., Socioeconomic integration and spatial patterns of immigrant groups in Canada, Population Research and Policy Review, 18, pp. 201-217, (1999); Balakrishnan T.R., Wu Z., Home ownership patterns and ethnicity in selected Canadian cities, Canadian Journal of Sociology, 17, 4, pp. 389-403, (1992); Bauder H., Lusis T., Local, Regional and Transnational Networks and The Integration and Settlement Dispersal of Filipino Immigrants, (2008); Bertolini L., Integrating Mobility and Urban Development Agendas: A Manifesto, DisP - the Planning Review, 188, 1, pp. 16-26, (2012); Booth C., Life and Labour of the People In London, (1902); Burgess E.W., The growth of the city: An introduction to a research project, The City, pp. 47-62, (1925); Carmichael K., IMF casts nervous eye on Canadian housing market, The Globe and Mail, (2011); Carrick R., Why renting is beginning to look like a great deal, The Globe and Mail, (2011); Carter T., The challenges of increasing diversity in areas of urban decline: A Winnipeg case study, Canadian Issues Fall, 2010, pp. 100-103, (2010); Carter T.S., Osborne J., Housing and neighbourhood challenges of refugee resettlement in declining inner city neighbourhoods: A Winnipeg case study, Journal of Immigrant and Refugee Studies, 7, 3, pp. 308-327, (2009); Chiang L.-H.N., Astronaut families': Transnational lives of middle-class Taiwanese married women in Canada, Social and Cultural Geography, 9, 5, pp. 505-518, (2008); Perspectives On Housing Tenure, (2006); Darden J.T., The Significance of White Supremacy In the Canadian Metropolis of Toronto, (2004); del Rio-Laquian E., Laquian A., Seeking a Better Life Abroad: A Study of Filipinos In Canada 1957-2007, (2008); Tower Neighbourhood Renewal In the Greater Golden Horseshoe: An Analysis of High-Rise Apartment Tower Neighbourhoods Developed In the Post-War Boom (1945-1984), (2010); Falicov C.J., Working with transnational immigrants: Expanding meanings of family, community, and culture, Family Process, 46, 2, pp. 157-171, (2007); Florida R., Financial recovery needs money - and a massively different mindset, The Globe and Mail, (2008); Ghosh S., Transnational ties and intra-immigrant group settlement experiences: A case study of Indian Bengalis and Bangladeshis in Toronto, GeoJournal, 68, pp. 223-242, (2007); Goldring L., Temporary Worker Programs as precarious, Canadian Issues, pp. 50-54, (2010); Gopikrishna S., Housing and Neighbourhoods: Future Research Directions, (2010); Graham J.M., Thurston W.E., Overcoming adversity: Resilience and coping mechanisms developed by recent immigrant women living in the inner city of Calgary, Alberta, Women's Health and Urban Life, 4, 1, pp. 63-80, (2005); Haan M., The decline of immigrant home-ownership advantage: Life-cycle, declining fortunes and changing housing careers in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver, Urban Studies, 42, 12, pp. 2191-2212, (2005); Haan M., The residential crowding of immigrants to Canada, Canadian Issues, pp. 16-21, (2010); Hall P.A., Lamont M., Successful Societies: How Institutions and Culture Affect Health, (2009); Hester R., Design For Ecological Democracy.

Urban ecologists currently have a unique opportunity to apply solid, evidence-based research to help create biodiversity-rich and sustainable cities and towns for the future. Unfortunately, there is currently a mismatch between the questions planners, designers and decision-makers are asking urban ecologists that would allow them to improve the biodiversity outcomes in urban areas, and the questions urban ecologists must ask to contribute to the development and application of the science of urban ecology. For a number of reasons, urban ecologists over the past 25 years have primarily focused on describing the patterns of biodiversity in cities and towns using broad, aggregate predictor variables (e.g., distance to city center, land-use, percent cover of impermeable surfaces and vegetation, etc.). We refer to these results as 'low-hanging fruit'. If the discipline of urban ecology is going to provide the necessary information to inform actions to preserve and enhance urban biodiversity, we need to move beyond place-based research, and work towards the development of confirmed generalizations regarding the relationship between the structure and function of urban ecosystems and biodiversity. We propose three essential strategies for achieving this refined understanding: 1) defining the study window to place the study into a broader global context, 2) collecting and using more explicit question-driven measures of the urban condition in order to improve our understanding of urban ecological drivers, as well as recording more detailed ecological responses to provide insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying an observed response, and 3) expanding studies to include multiple cities, regions and countries. These strategies will help to expedite the ability of urban ecology to contribute to the creation of biodiversity-rich, healthy, resilient cities and towns. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Actionable science; Aggregate variables; Comparative ecology; Confirmed generalisations; Mechanistic understanding; Specific variables; Urban biodiversity; Urban predictor variables; Urban response variables","","Adler P.B., Seabloom E.W., Borer E.T., Et al., Productivity is a poor predictor of plant species richness, Science, 333, pp. 1750-1753, (2011); Alberti M., Advances in Urban Ecology: Integrating Humans and Ecological Processes in Urban Ecosystems, (2008); Allen T.F.H., Starr T.B., Hierarchy: Perspectives for ecological complexity, (1982); Apostolopoulou E., Paloniemi R., Frames of scale challenges in Finnish and Greek biodiversity conservation, Ecol Soc, 17, (2012); Barber J.R., Crooks K.R., Fristrup K.M., The costs of chronic noise exposure for terrestrial organisms, Trends Ecol Evol, 25, pp. 180-189, (2010); Becker A., Whitfield A.K., Cowley P.D., Jarnegren J., Naesje T.F., Potential effects of artificial light associated with anthropogenic infrastructure on the abundance and foraging behaviour of estuary-associated fishes, J Appl Ecol, 50, pp. 43-50, (2013); Bonnington C., Gaston K.J., Evan K.L., Fearing the feline: domestic cats reduce avian fecundity through trait-mediated indirect effects that increase nest predation by other species, J Appl Ecol, 50, pp. 15-24, (2013); Boone C.G., Cook E., Hall S.J., Nation M.L., Grimm N.B., Raish C.B., Finch D.M., York A.M., A comparative gradient approach as a tool for understanding and managing urban ecosystems, Urban Ecosyst, 15, pp. 795-807, (2012); Cadenasso M.L., Pickett S.T.A., Urban principles for ecological landscape design and management: Scientific fundamentals Cities and the Environment, pp. 1-16, (2008); Clergeau P., Jokimaki J., Snep R., Using hierarchical levels for urban ecology, Trends Ecol Evol, 21, pp. 660-661, (2006); Cronon W., The uses of environmental history.

How can cities, as complex systems, be resilient? Building a capacity for resilience might be a daunting task when one considers the multitude of components, processes, and interactions that take place within and beyond a city's physical, logical (i.e. legal), and virtual (cyberspace) boundaries. Planning for resilience to the impacts of stressors within cities requires an evaluation of the vulnerable components of cities, an understanding of the key processes, procedures, and interactions that organize these components and develop the capacity to address various structuring of components and their interactions with the ultimate goal of achieving resilience. This paper provides a deeper look at resilience in cities, proposes a conceptual resilience framework, and includes a discussion and analysis of the framework. The proposed framework is meant to serve as a more holistic approach to designing, planning, and managing for resilience by including an evaluation of cultural and process dynamics within cities as well as their physical elements. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cities; Decline; Disaster; Disruption; Resilience; Stressors; Technology; Urban networks; Urban planning","conceptual framework; disaster management; holistic approach; urban area; urban development; urban planning","Alfasi N., Portugali J., Planning just-in-time versus planning just-in-case, Cities, 21, 1, pp. 29-39, (2004); (2013); Axelrod R., Cohen M., Harnessing complexity: Organizational implications of a scientific frontier, (1999); Batty M., Cities and complexity: Understanding cities with cellular automata, agent-based models, and fractals, (2005); Batty M., Marshall S., The origins of complexity theory in cities and planning, Complexity theories of cities have come of age, pp. 24-47, (2012); (2005); Boyd E., Folke C., Adapting institutions: Governance, complexity, and social-ecological resilience, (2012); Burnside W.R., Brown J.H., Burger O., Hamilton M.J., Moses M., Bettencourt L.M.A., Human macroecology: Linking pattern and process in big-picture human ecology, Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 87, 1, pp. 194-208, (2012); Carpenter S.R., Walker B.H., Anderies J.M., Abel N., From metaphor to measurement: Resilience of what to what?, Ecosystems, 4, pp. 765-781, (2001); Changizi M.A., Destefano M., Common scaling laws for city highway systems and the mammalian neocortex, Complexity, (2009); Colten C., Kates R., Laska S., Three years after Katrina - Lessons for community resilience, Environment, 50, 5, pp. 36-47, (2008); Cumming G.S., Spatial resilience: Integrating landscape ecology, resilience, and sustainability, Landscape Ecology, 26, 7, pp. 899-909, (2011); Desouza K.C., Designing and planning for smart(er) cities, Practicing Planner, 10, 4, (2012); Desouza K.C., (2012); Desouza K.C., Flanery T.H., Alex J., Park E., (2012); Desouza K.C., Hensgen T., Managing information in complex organizations: Semiotics and signals, complexity and chaos, (2005); Eisinger P., Business as usual: New York City after 9/11, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 31, pp. 875-879, (2007); George R., (2013); Harrigan J., Martin P., Terrorism and the resilience of cities, Economic Policy Review - Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 8, 2, (2002); Hellstrom T., Critical infrastructure and systemic vulnerability: Towards a planning framework, Safety Science, 45, 3, pp. 415-430, (2007); Innes J.E., Booher D.E., Planning with complexity: An introduction to collaborative rationality for public policy, (2010); Irons M., (2013); Klein J., (2010); Marshall S., Planning, design and the complexity of cities, Complexity theories of cities have come of age, pp. 191-205, (2012); Mitroff I.I., Crisis management: Cutting through the confusion.

The UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction program is asking cities %How resilient is your city'. The ITA Committee on Underground Space (ITACUS) is working together with UNISDR to demonstrate how the use of underground space can contribute to making cities more resilient. The use of underground space is underrated worldwide, yet it can prove to be invaluable to city governments as a strategic planning asset. This paper explores the issues and shows how underground space is already contributing. The main focus will be on those aspects that help cities cope with rapid urbanization and their efforts to become more resilient. Areas which will be explored include buildings, transport, energy supply, water and waste. The question will also be raised whether the use of underground space can take place as an autonomous activity or whether planning the use of underground space is required. In the opinion of the author the latter is the case. City governments require awareness of both the advantages of underground space use but also of the need to plan using this asset in a sustainable way. Only in that way will the use of underground space be to the advantage of cities.

Our main focus is to review policies and strategies and institutional settings in order to identify institutional challenges to mainstream climate smart disaster risk reduction strategies in cities of Bangladesh. Therefore, the key contributions of this chapter are that we (a) identify possible entry points for mainstreaming climate smart risk management strategies, and (b) recognise some broad institutional constraints to address effectively climate change risks. Cities are at risk of the impacts of climate change on infrastructure, human lives, human health, and environmental quality. These effects will deepen in coming decades. Climate smart disaster risk management (CSDRM) approach can be considered as a holistic approach, because it provides guidelines to build adaptive capacities of local people and also local institutions. This chapter deals with some important core concepts such as institution, climate smart disaster risk management, adaptation capacity, and the institutional adaptation capacity. This chapter focuses particularly on the institutional challenges to mainstream climate smart strategies in cities of Bangladesh. For this, the chapter reviews policies, institutional settings, and legal frameworks underway in Bangladesh that respond to climate change, and discusses what currently constrains this. The review reveals that national as well as local level institutions in Bangladesh are already grappling with large deficits which limit capacity of these institutions to mainstream climate smart risk reduction strategies. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate Smart Disaster Risk Management; Institutions and institutional challenges; Urban resilience","","Alam M., Rabbani G., Vulnerabilities and responses to climate change for Dhaka, Environ Urban, 19, pp. 81-97, (2007); Ayers J.M., Huq S., The Value of Linking Mitigation and Adaptation: A Case Study from Bangladesh.

In most strategies, however, water ecosystems, which are the fundamental component of the integrated urban water resources management (IUWRM), are regarded as objects of protection or rehabilitation; not, as postulated by ecohydrology, as management tools. This paper addresses the possibilities of: (i) the functional incorporation of aquatic ecosystems into the IUWRM; (ii) optimising their functioning by local ecohydrological approach; and (iii) integration of ecosystem functions on a city scale to build system solutions for more resilient cities. Two case studies of the UNESCO MAB/IHP demonstration network representing different urban development patterns are given. The City of Łódź (Poland) uses water-resource based urban retrofitting for improving the quality of life and attracting inhabitants, departing from the analysis of longitudinal dynamics of nutrient transition in the river-reservoirs system, towards proposing an alternative concept of spatial city development. The city of Lyon (France), with intensive periurban development and population growth, provides a hierarchy of stream reaches to cope with combined sewer overflows to help municipalities to better position future urban runoff outlets. This article envisions also the future management of urban waste and storm waters using urban rivers, assuming resilient cities will depend on the integrity of environmental, technical and spatial planning decisions. The virtues of ecohydrology are discussed in this respect. © 2013 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of Polish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.

The rapidity and the efficiency of the recovery process are referred to as resilience. A mathematical definition of resilience of an urban community has not yet been identified.We propose and test a methodology for the assessment of urban resilience to a catastrophic event. The idea is to merge the concepts of engineering resilience and ecosystem resilience. As first step we model a urban community by means of different hybrid complex networks, composed by human elements, i.e. the citizens, and physical elements, i.e. urban lifelines and infrastructures. As second step, we define a class of efficiency indexes on these hybrid networks. Then, we quantify the resilience of a urban system by computing these efficiency indexes before a simulated catastrophic event, after the event has occurred and during the subsequent recovery process. As a case study, we test this idea in case of simulated earthquakes in the city of Acerra, Italy. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","","Efficiency; Recovery; Reliability; Safety engineering; Catastrophic event; Ecosystem resilience; Mathematical definitions; Physical elements; Recovery process; Urban community; Urban networks; Urban resilience; Earthquakes","Ahmad N., Crowley H., Pinho R., Analytical Fragility Functions for Reinforced Concrete and Masonry Buildings and Building Aggregates of Euro-Mediterranean Regions, (2011); Bar-Yam Y., Dynamics of Complex Systems, (2003); Batty M., Cities and Complexity, (2005); Bruneau M., Et al., A framework to quantitatively assess and enhance the seismic resilience of communities, Earthquake Spectra, 19, 4, (2003); Cosenza E., Manfredi G., L'Aquila: Il Progetto, (2010); Crucitti P., Latora V., Porta S., Centrality measures in spatial networks of urban streets, Phys.

It focuses on public space, proposing an inversion of the usual perspective: Instead of considering public spaces for risk mitigation and urban redevelopment, here the imperatives of environmental safety and urban resilience can be instrumental for exploring the meaning and role of the public space from a different, rather compelling point of view. Instrumental for exploring the meaning and role of the public space from a different, rather compelling point of view. One starting point is the concept of SUM, Strategic Urban Structure (or Framework), from the Italian ""Struttura urbana minima"", which has been introduced in order to set out the contents of urban risk reduction in local administration agendas and particularly into ordinary planning processes. The SUM has been conceived both as an analytical and a normative/planning tool. Public spaces are the backbone of both urban structure and of the SUM. From their features, localization, distribution within the settlement, and their systemic characters, largely depend the capacity of a town to positively react to a seismic event. Six casestudies of small and mediumsize historic towns in the Umbria Region (one of the many Italian Regions with a high level of seismic risk), help to understand the complexities and problems related to seismic prevention within historical centres, and the conflicts between conservation of the heritage and the imperatives of environmental safety. In order to overcome possible criticalities identified in a SUM, it is necessary to provide alternatives to its functioning through redundant elements. The concept of redundancy, which is strictly related to that of uncertainty, is very interesting and promising in this field of research.","","","Arrow K., Social Choice and Individual Values, (1963); Bauer Wurster C., Explorations Into Urban Structure, (1967); Benetti D., Guccione M., Segnalini O., Primo repertorio dei centri storici in Umbria - Il terremoto del 26 settembre, (1998); Benigno F., Scuccimarral, Il governo dell'emergenza.

This initiative was undertaken in the second phase (2009-2010) of Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) programme (www.acccrn.org). The process of resilience planning has demonstrated how local organizations have used new climate and urbanization information to identify vulnerabilities and capacities to develop integrated resilience plans. Local engagement in the development of the City Resilience Strategies resulted in a much greater understanding of the climate change issues and resilience processes among local and national partners. The strategy provides an overarching framework informed by visioning exercise, hazard risk assessment, vulnerability analysis, sector studies and pilot projects to demonstrate effectiveness of resilience options. Risk assessment was conducted to get a better understanding of impacts on city. City wide vulnerability assessment was carried out using object oriented analysis techniques to capture current vulnerability of different sections of population across space and socio-economic categories. The issue of climate change is cross-cutting, therefore, sector studies were undertaken to determine the degree to which existing systems can response to varying climatic conditions. The assessment results were integrated to draw an informed resilience approach for the cities in dealing with climate variability and change. Resilience strategy development was informed by climate science, hazard risk information, urban planning/development framework, current vulnerability and anticipated future risks. The resilience strategy is grounded on was resource constraints, economic development and critical uncertainties. Engagement with different institutions was carried out through extensive studies and consolidation from series of risk to resilience (R2R) workshops. This led to the empowerment and ownership by city stakeholders for the resilience strategy. This study is one of the pioneering efforts towards developing urban resilience strategies under changing climate scenarios for Indian cities. The methodology adapted for the two cities are currently being owned and replicated by other cities in India.","ACCCRN; City resilience strategy; Climate change adaptation","Economic and social effects; Economics; Hazards; Planning; Project management; Risk assessment; Risk management; ACCCRN; Climate change adaptation; Climate change scenarios; Climate variability and change; Current vulnerabilities; Object-oriented analysis; Resilience strategy; Vulnerability assessments; Climate change","Census, Census of India, (2011); Kennedy C., Urban metabolism, Technical Report, Encyclopedia of Earth, (2007); Parry M., Canziani O., Palutikof J., Van Der Linden P., Hanson C., Summary for policymakers, Climate Change, pp. 7-22, (2007)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924954217"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a literature review and a case study conducted in the Batticaloa city of Sri Lanka, supported by expert interviews among local and other government officials, policy makers, practitioners and academics who are engaged in disaster management and urban planning within the country. Findings: The literature and empirical data reveal that local governments are facing a number of challenges in contributing to making cities resilient to disasters. Some of the issues that have emerged are inadequate financial and human resource capabilities; a lack of knowledge of disaster risks and vulnerabilities; the need for long-term political commitment; a lack of focus on pre-disaster planning; inadequate legislative authority; a lack of clear cut responsibilities and coordination among agencies; and a lack of involvement in major development activities, physical planning and regulation of land use. It is important to address these challenges faced by local governments in creating a disaster resilient built environment in a holistic manner to ensure effective disaster risk reduction within cities. Research limitations/implications: The paper is based on partial findings of research which aims to explore and propose mechanisms to empower the Sri Lankan local governments to make cities more resilient to disasters, within the context of the built environment. Originality/value: The paper identifies the weaknesses of the current institutional arrangements in place for creating a disaster resilient built environment in Sri Lanka and highlights the challenges faced by a local government in creating a disaster resilient built environment within a Sri Lankan city. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cities;

Whilst the human health issues have been covered in detail in policy and academic arenas, much less attention has been paid to the adverse impacts on urban infrastructure. Analysis of this event, underpinned by participatory actor-based research, has shown that the impacts were experienced disproportionately across different infrastructure types. For water, telecommunications and airports, the impacts were relatively minor and the impact on rail transport and roads (and to a lesser extent, seaports) was of moderate significance, whereas research findings indicate that the electricity sector was found to be the most vulnerable. This paper focuses on the sectors that were worst impacted: electricity, rail and road transport. Commentary identifies the direct and indirect impacts of the heat event, including associated cascading effects, as well as considering actual and potential adaptation responses both before and after the event. Concluding, the authors reflect on the implications of the heat wave for urban resilience, emphasising the crucial importance of understanding the urban environment as a complex and interconnected system. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adaptation; climate impacts; heat wave; infrastructure; urban system","Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]; adaptive management; climate effect; heat island; infrastructure; natural hazard; urban area","Toward a City of Melbourne climate change adaptation strategy.

This has become central to the exploration of methods for achieving truly sustainable urban growth. However, while transitioning and resilience are useful descriptors, they can be abstract or conflicting ideals and their meanings obscured by a lack of concrete examples, both being barriers to many planning objectives. In this paper, we hold a lens over key issues in transitioning to resilience in urban areas by outlining emerging challenges that may offer directions towards operationalising how cities might transition to a more resilient future, while ensuring that communities are at the center of the process. The emerging and challenging areas - geospatial ICT, green infrastructure planning, novel design using collaborative responses, climate planning, limiting urban sprawl and short-circuit economic approaches - are explored as viable facets for devising and sustaining urban transition strategies. We conclude with a discussion on the need for developing a synergistic approach in practice to facilitate transition. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Sustainability; Transition strategy; Urban resilience","adaptive management;

As such it is following sustainability, sometimes even used interchangeably. It is argued that, with a sound theoretical framework for an urban regional context still pending, it is difficult to apply resilience as a new paradigm to planning practice. Based on conceptual thoughts on resilience particularly in relation to the concept of sustainability, this contribution suggests that one challenge for urban regional resilience is the need for intensified collaboration between different disciplines as well as between science and practice. It concludes with suggestions on how to approach this challenge using existing platforms such as conferences or collaborative projects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Collaborative projects; Complexity; Environmental planning; Planning theory; Sustainability; Trans-disciplinary research; Urban resilience","complexity; conceptual framework; environmental planning; planning practice; planning theory; project management; spatial planning; sustainability","Davoudi S., Resilience: A bridging concept or a dead end?, Planning Theory & Practice, 13, 2, pp. 299-307, (2012); Deppisch S., Schaerffer M., Given the complexity of large cities, can Urban Resilience be attained at all?, German annual of spatial research and policy 2010, (2010); Felgentreff C., Kuhlicke C., Westholt F., (2012); (2012); (2004)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878913779"

An important element developed is the nominal residence time of the energy stocks. This value defines how long an energy stock lasts under typical patterns of energy use. The findings suggest that the residence times of many sources of energy overcome vulnerability when energy supply shocks last on the order of hours or a few days, but that the measure is limited to assessing only certain types of commonly used energy sources in aggregate terms. Discussion is included on the uncertainty of this measure and on the metabolic and resiliency implications of new technologies intended to reduce energy use and improve sustainability of cities and the use of the urban metabolism as a means of comparison. The methodology employed highlights how waste energy could be used to increase the resiliency of the city's water supply, but also how the study of the urban metabolism would benefit from a more disaggregate form in the study of sustainable and resilient cities. © 2013 by Yale University.","Energy cycling; Energy stock; Industrial ecology; Residence time; Urban metabolism; Vulnerability","Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; Physiology; Water supply; Energy cycling; Energy stock; Industrial ecology; Residence time; Urban metabolisms; Vulnerability; demand-side management; energy conservation; energy use; sustainable development; technological development; uncertainty analysis; urban area; water supply; Metabolism","Albert R., Albert I., Nakarado G.L., Structural vulnerability of the North American power grid, Physical Review E, Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics, 69, 2 PART 2, (2004); Allen T.F.H., Tainter J.A., Hoekstra T.W., Supply-side sustainability, Systems Research and Behavioural Science, 16, 5, pp. 403-427, (1999); Bristow D., Kennedy C.A., Potential of building-scale alternative energy to alleviate risk from the future price of energy, Energy Policy, 38, 4, pp. 1885-1894, (2010); Bristow D.N., Kennedy C.A., Maximizing the use of energy in cities using an open systems network approach, Ecological Modelling, 250, pp. 155-164, (2013); Brunner P.H., Rechberger H., Anthropogenic metabolism and environmental legacies, Encyclopedia of global environmental change, volume 3, causes and consequences of global environmental change, pp. 54-72, (2003); Household preparedness for public health emergencies-14 states, 2006-2010, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 61, 36, pp. 713-729, (2012); (2007); (2009); (2010); 2006 transportation tomorrow survey city of Toronto summary by wards, (2009); Eastwood M., Understanding Canada's urban forests: A comparison of the results of the UFORE model for Toronto, Oakville, Calgary and Kelowna, (2007); FAOSTAT food balance sheets, (2012); Gormley M., Hays T., (2012); Grewal S.S., Grewal P.S., Can cities become self-reliant in food?, Cities, 29, 1, pp. 85-110, (2012); Grubler A., Bai X., Buettner T., Dhakal S., Fisk D.J., Ichinose T., Keirstead J.E., Sammer G., Satterthwaite D., Schulz N.B., Shah N., Steinberger J., Weisz H., Et al., Urban energy systems, Global energy assessment-Toward a sustainable future, pp. 1307-1400, (2012); Gunderson L.H., Holling C.S., Panarchy: Understanding transformations in human and natural systems, (2001); Harvey D., Energy and the new reality: Facing up to climatic change, volume 1: Energy efficiency and the demand for energy services, (2010); Hashimoto T., Stedinger J.R., Loucks D.P., Reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability criteria for water resource system performance evaluation, Water Resources Research, 18, 1, pp. 14-20, (1982); Heidrich E.S., Curtis T.P., Dolfing J., Determination of the internal chemical energy of wastewater, Environmental Science & Technology, 45, 2, pp. 827-832, (2011); Hipel K.W., Fang L., Heng M., System of systems approach to policy development for global food security, Journal of Systems Science and Systems Engineering, 19, 1, pp. 1-21, (2010); (2012); Keirstead J., Schulz N.B., London and beyond: Taking a closer look at urban energy policy, Energy Policy, 38, 9, pp. 4870-4879, (2010); Kennedy C.A., The evolution of great world cities: Urban wealth and economic growth, (2011); Kennedy C.A., A mathematical description of urban metabolism, Sustainability science: The emerging paradigm and the urban environment, (2012); Kennedy C.A., Cuddihy J., Engel-Yan J., The changing metabolism of cities, Journal of Industrial Ecology, 11, 2, pp. 43-59, (2007); Kennedy C.A., Pincetl S., Bunje P., The study of urban metabolism and its applications to urban planning and design, Environmental Pollution, 159, 8-9, pp. 1965-1973, (2011); Kennedy C.A., Steinberger J.K., Gasson B., Hansen Y., Hillman T., Havranek M., Pataki D., Phdungsilp A., Ramaswami A., Mendez G.V., Greenhouse gas emissions from global cities, Environmental Science & Technology, 43, 19, pp. 7297-7302, (2009); Krogmann U., Andrews C.J., Kim M., Kiss G., Miflin C., Water mass balances for the Solaire and the 2020 Tower: Implications for closing the water loop in high-rise buildings, Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 43, 6, pp. 1414-1423, (2007); Lasseter R.H., Paigi P., Microgrid: A conceptual solution, Power electronics specialists conference, 2004.

The paper provides an overview of the pertinent concepts as well as the various approaches to the assessment of the resilience of cities. It elaborates on the concepts of complexity and dynamic systems and attempts to clarify the concept of resilience itself by analysing its characteristics and contrasting it with related concepts such as sustainability, resistance, equilibrium, stability, durability and robustness. It proposes that the essence of resilience is the ability of a system to absorb changes without a transition to a different state. © 2012 WIT Press.","Cities; Complexity; Resilience; Sustainability; Systems","Communication; Computer systems; Cities; Complexity; Resilience; Urban resilience; Sustainable development","Prasad N., Ranghieri F., Trohanis S.Z., Kessler F.E., Ravi S., Climate Resilient Cities.

During the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in the approach to disaster management. A recent trend has been to encourage more community participation as opposed to the top-down approach of the past. It is believed that community participation will bring about a comprehensive and accurate appreciation of people's perception regarding hazards, risk, vulnerability, and resilience, and this research is an attempt to achieve just that. In order to accomplish our goal, we engaged a group of women that would typically fall into the category of ""vulnerable group"" in a focus group interview setting. The participants were mainly over 40 years old, the majority with little education, unemployed, facing language barriers, of low income, and reliant on public transit. Many participants identified that they lived in the vicinity of rivers, lakes, railways, or power plants, but did not seem to be aware of their exposure to potential threats-indicating a lack of education and awareness. The most common hazards and mitigation measures they were aware of, included floods (including basement flooding), fire, fire alarm, and smoke detectors. Additionally, illness and loneliness were mentioned as factors contributing to their increased vulnerability, hence reduced resiliency. With the help of the focus group members' participation, we were able to discuss the importance of communities being aware of their surroundings, available resources and help, and permit them to voice their concerns in order to be able to cope during emergencies. We trust and hope that more community participation will lead to stronger and more resilient cities. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Community participation; Community resilience; Disaster; Risk perception; Vulnerability","disaster management; local participation; participatory approach; resource allocation; risk perception; top-down approach; vulnerability","Alexander D., Principles of emergency planning and management, (2002); Armenakis C., Nirupama N., Prioritization of Disaster Risk in a Community Using GIS, (2011); Birkmann J., Measuring vulnerability to natural hazards: Towards disaster resilient societies, (2006); Brown O., Crawford A., Hammill A., Natural Disasters and Resource Rights: Building Resilience, Rebuilding Lives, (2006); Etkin D., Haque, An assessment of natural hazards and disasters in Canada, Kluwer Academic, pp. 211-589, (2003); (2011); Ferrier N., Haque E., Hazards risk assessment methodology for emergency managers: a standardized framework for application, Nat Hazards, 28, pp. 271-290, (2003); Green C., The evaluation of vulnerability to flooding, Disaster Prev Manag, 13, 4, pp. 323-329, (2004); Guidelines Risk Analysis-a Basis for Disaster Risk Management, (2004); Helm P., Integrated risk management for natural and technological disasters, Tephra, 15, 1, pp. 4-13, (1996); Hewitt K., Regions of risk: A geographical introduction to disasters, (1997); (2004); Living with risk: A global review of disaster reduction initiatives, (2004); A science plan for integrated research on disaster risk-addressing the challenge of natural and human-induced environmental hazards, (2008); Jaeger C.C., Renn O., Rosa E.A., Webler T., Risk, Uncertainty, and Rational Action, (2001); Mathew A., Kelly K., Disaster preparedness in urban immigrant communities: Lessons learned from recent catastrophic events and their relevance to Latino and Asian Communities in Southern California, (2008); Mileti D.S., Disasters by Design, (1999); Nirupama N., Disaster risk management: Theory, practice and policy, (2008); (2009); Olanubi T., Crisis management and psychosocial intervention: Perception of immigrants, Major research paper, MA in disaster and emergency management, (2009); (2011); Slovic P., The Perception of Risk, (2000); Smith K., Environmental Hazards, (2004); Stewart R.M., Community perspectives of flood risk and social vulnerability reduction: The case of the Red River Basin, Doctoral Thesis, (2007); Tierney K.J., Toward a critical sociology of risk, Sociol Forum, 14, 2, pp. 215-242, (1999); Tobin G.A., Montz B.E., Natural Hazards: Explanation and Integration, (1997); Twigg J., Characteristics of a disaster-resilient community, (2007); Targeting Vulnerability: Guidelines for Local Activities and Events, (2001); Whyte A.V., Burton I., Perception of risk in Canada, Living with Risk, pp. 39-69, (1982); Wisner B., Blaikie P., Cannon T., Davis I., At risk: Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters, (2004)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84873470394"

The dependent variable is an estimate of clearance time in hours derived using network analysis techniques within a geographic information system. We find that tracts with a more peripheral location, more female residents, a higher proportion of Hispanic residents, and higher median household incomes are associated with higher clearance times, on average. Our research suggests the relationship between suburbanization and clearance time is complex and evolving, mediated by past investments in the built environment and shifting social conditions. In addition to facilitating the evacuation of areas with low access to personal vehicles, urban planners and emergency management officials should also consider how the degree of connectivity in the street network impacts congestion and clearance time. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","disaster planning; hurricane evacuation; multilevel modeling; resilient cities; US Gulf Coast","Gulf; Papua New Guinea; congestion; connectivity; disaster; female; hurricane; information system; network analysis; regression analysis; social characteristics; suburbanization","Adger W.N., Vulnerability, Global Environmental Change, 16, 3, pp. 268-281, (2006); Anselin L., Local indicators of spatial association, Geographical Analysis, 27, 2, pp. 93-115, (1995); Baker E.J., Hurricane evacuation behavior, International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, 9, 2, pp. 287-310, (1991); Baker E.J., Hurricane evacuation in the United States, Storms, pp. 308-319, (2000); Barrett B., Ran B., Pillai R., Developing a dynamic traffic management modeling framework for hurricane evacuation.

So, urban resilience has to face up to climate risks. The most impacting phenomenon is the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The storage capacity of heat is depending on shapes of buildings, public spaces, spatial organization, transport or even industrial activities. So, adaptive strategies for improving urban climate could be possible in different ways. In the framework of the French project Resilis, this study characterises urban vulnerability and resilience in terms of energy needs of buildings and outside urban comfort according to the IPCC carbon dioxide emission scenarios B2 and A2 for the period 2050-2100 for 10 French cities. The evolutions of four climate indicators in terms of heating and cooling needs and number of hours when the temperature is above 28 °C are then obtained for each city to analyse climate risks and their impacts in urban environment. © Author(s) 2012.","","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; cooling; heat island; heating; urban area","Akbari A., Pomerantz M., Taha H., Cool surfaces and shade trees to reduce energy use and improve air quality in urban areas, Sol.

This paper examines the changing nature of resilience strategies since 2000 and highlights how planners increasingly are asked to contribute to this agenda. Drawing on the emerging theories of urban resilience, this paper charts the emergence of different 'styles' of resilience over the last decade in the UK, with an emphasis on a range of policies associated with designing safer spaces. Emerging lessons are then deployed to highlight how a new generation of urban resilience practice is now emerging associated with embedding resiliency into local place-making activities. This paper concludes by reflecting upon the multiple uses of resilience in planning practice. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","localism; place-making; planning; resilience; security","United Kingdom; national planning; planning practice; security; strategic approach; urban area","Adger N., Soicla nd ecologicla resileince: Are they related?, Progress in Human Geography, 24, pp. 347-364, (2000); Albers M., Deppisch S., Resilience in the light of climate change: Useful approach or empty phrase for spatial planning?, European Planning Studies, pp. 1-13, (2012); Benton-Short L., Bollards, bunkers, and barriers: Securing the National Mall in Washington, DC, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 25, 3, pp. 424-446, (2007); Bosher L.S., Hazards and the Built Environment: Attaining Built-in Resilience, (2008); Bosher L., Coaffee J., Urban resilience: An international perspective, Proceeding of the Institute of Civil Engineers: Urban Design and Planning, 161, pp. 145-146, (2008); Boyle P., Haggerty K., Spectacular security: Mega-events and the security complex, International Political Sociology, 3, pp. 257-274, (2009); Briggs R., Joining Forces: From National Security to Networked Security, (2005); Brown S., Central Belfast's security segment: An urban phenomenon, Area, 17, 1, pp. 1-8, (1985); Burby R.J., Deyle R.E., Godschalk D.R., Olshansky R.B., Creating hazard resilient communities through land-use planning, Natural Hazards Review, 1, 2, pp. 99-106, (2000); Dealing with Disaster, (2003); National Risk Register, (2008); Realising Britain's Potential: Future Strategic Challenges for Britain, (2008); Building Britain's Future, (2009); Big Society, (2011); Strategic National Framework on Community Resilience, (2011); Coaffee J., Terrorism, Risk and the City, (2003); Coaffee J., Rings of steel, rings of concrete and rings of confidence: Designing out terrorism in central London pre and post 9/11, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 28, 1, pp. 201-211, (2004); Coaffee J., From counter-terrorism to resilience, European Legacy-Journal of the International Society for the Study of European Ideas (ISSEI), 11, 4, pp. 389-403, (2006); Coaffee J., Risk, resilience, and environmentally sustainable cities, Energy Policy, 36, 12, pp. 4633-4638, (2008); Coaffee J., What is the role and responsibility of planners and urban designers?

As I will argue, the intensifying and mutually supportive relationship between the NFL and the various forces employed to keep it safe is both unique in US sports and implies the militarization of football fans in somewhat unexpected ways. I will argue that the security strategies of the US government and those of the NFL are mutually beneficial in ways that help secure the NFL's position and profitability and, more importantly, help implement and secure consensus for the US Department of Homeland Security's continued ‘war on terror’. Coaffee's recent work on urban resilience in the UK (Coaffee, 2009; Coaffee and Wood, 2006) contends that in the present historical moment, ‘security is becoming more civic, urban, domestic, and personal’ (Coaffee, 2009: 9). How, if at all, does resilience play out in the context of anti-terrorism policy in post-9/11 America? How, if at all, does US professional football articulate with that policy? These are two key questions I intend to address during the course of this article. © 2012, SAGE Publications.

It is an important subject to improve sustainability of cities, urban landscapes, and agrarian society. Establishing the urban-rural linkages is a critical endeavor for the quality of life in urban areas. The present work elaborates the historical evolution of urban agriculture in the world. The review of different urban agriculture cases through literature and internet searches highlighted the effects of different eras on urban agriculture. The final outcome is presented in the form of a chronological diagram of urban agriculture. The findings show that through the history agriculture has played a big role in development of cities. It was the war, crises, and famine that contributed agriculture to rise in urban areas as a vital solution. The shortages and scarcity that came after the wars, created the 'back to the land' vision. Subsequently, the awareness influenced the lifestyle in every dimension, from political to architecture, and to landscape. Food, as one of the primary material of humans' lifecycle, was eventually recognized by communities and governments due to the emerging concept of sustainability.","","Architecture; Food supply; Search engines; Stream flow; Sustainable development; Historical evolutions; Internet searches; Primary materials; Quality of life; Urban agricultures; Urban areas; Urban landscape; Urban-rural; Agriculture","Ando T., Toward New Horizons in Architecture, Theorizing New Agenda for Architecture: An Antology of Architectural Theory, pp. 456-461, (1991); Antrop M., Why landscapes of the past are important for the future, Landscape and Urban Planning, 70, pp. 21-34, (2005); Akyol, Evolution of Urban Agriculture Concept and Determination of Design Criteria, (2011); Bakker N., Et al., Büyüyen Kentler Ve Büyüyen Gida Sorunu : Politika Gündemindeki Kent Tarimi, (2005); Burchardt J., Agricultural history rural history or countryside history?, Historical Journal, 50, 2, pp. 465-481, (2007); Crouch D., Ward C., The Allotment: Its Landscape and Culture, (1998); Gurler E.E., The Evaluation of Landscape Design Concepts Within the Framework of Interdisciplinary Interactions, (2011); Howard E., Garden Cities of To-morrow.

Urban systems change and reorganise according to the diverse outcomes of economic globalisation, based primarily on population data, but with secondary reference to trends in economic growth and restructuring, and to the various roles played by governments in shaping the urbanisation process (Bourne 1995). Thus, economic growth and restructuring resulting from globalisation creates certain population dynamics and mobility patterns that influence the reorganisation of urban spaces (drivers of the economic globalisation are discussed in detail in Chap. 5 for the case study areas introduced in this book). The reorganisation of urban space, which is strongly influenced by the adaptation strategies of cities to global processes and endogenous capacities, takes various forms. This chapter intends to explore these spatial forms and dynamics and their implications on the resilience of cities. It is argued in Chap. 1 that certain spatial patterns may provide capacity to the system to absorb disturbances and reorganise itself. In this chapter, in order to understand the extent of the spatial dynamics to address social and spatial challenges, both the inner city and peri-urbanised areas, first of all, these spatial dynamics are identified, and secondly, their relation to the attributes of resilience is clarified. In this respect this chapter aims to provide an umbrella conceptual framework for the relationship between spatial change and resilience. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Spatial Dynamic; Urban Development; Urban Policy; Urban Sprawl; Urban System","","Alberti M., The effects of urban patterns on ecosystem function, International Regional Science Review, 28, 2, pp. 168-192, (2005); Alberti M., Marzluff J.M., Ecological resilience in urban ecosystems: Linking urban patterns to human and ecological functions, Urban Ecosystems, 7, 3, pp. 241-265, (2004); Albrechts L., How to proceed from image and discourse to action: As applied to the Flemish diamond, Urban Studies, 38, 4, pp. 733-745, (2001); Angel S., Sheppard S.C., Civco D.L., The Dynamics of Global Urban Expansion.

By means of a case study in an urban context, the role of place and social capital is analyzed during the emergency period following the earthquake occurred on 27 February 2010 in Chile. Results indicate that both factors strongly modified the inherent resilience of the city and the community. At first, citizens' capacity to absorb shocks generated b the event was surpassed, forcing people to adapt quickly to the new situation, drawing on the resources available in the area. the emergence of groups and unheard of behavior, as well as site characteristics, contributed positively to improve the adaptive resilience of the community. these factors should be considered in planning and/or reconstruction of more resilient cities. © EURE.","Social capital; Urban planning; Vulnerability","Chile; adaptive management; Chile earthquake 2010; natural disaster; planning process; social capital; urban planning; urban population; vulnerability","Comfort L.K., Shared Risk: Complex Systems In Seismic Response, (1999); Roja C., Social Media Grows Up - Red Cross Emergency Social Data Summit, (2010); Cutter S.L., Boruff B.J., Shirley B.L., Social vulnerability to environmental hazards, Social Science Quarterly, 84, 2, pp. 242-261, (2003); Cutter S., Barnes L., Berry M., Burton C., Evans E., Tate E., Webb J., A place-based model for understanding community resilience to natural disasters, Global Environmental Change, 18, pp. 598-606, (2008); Cutter S., Barnes L., Berry M., Burton C., Evans E., Tate E., Webb J., Community and Regional Resilience: Perspectives From Hazards, Disasters and Emergency Management, (2008); Duran M., Plan Regulador San Pedro De La Paz, (2006); Dynes R., The Importance of Social Capital In Disaster Response, (2002); Disaster Profiles, (2012); Marco De Acción De Hyogo Para 2005-2015: Aumento De La Resiliencia De Las Naciones Y Las Comunidades Ante Los Desastres, (2005); Folke C., Carpenter S., Elmqvist T., Gunderson L., Holling C.S., Walker B., Resilience and sustainable development: Building adaptive capacity in a world of transformations, Ambio, 31, 5, pp. 437-440, (2002); Folke C., Hahn T., Olsson P., Norberg J., Adaptive governance of socio-ecological systems, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 30, pp. 441-473, (2005); Franck S., Perez L., Más que una suma de casas.

The paper reviews hazard mitigation practice, defines a resilient city, considers the relationship between resilience and terrorism, and discusses why resilience is important and how to apply its principles to physical and social elements of cities. Contending that current hazard mitigation policy, practice, and knowledge fail to deal with the unique aspects of cities under stress, the paper recommends a major resilient cities initiative, including expanded urban systems research, education and training, and increased collaboration among professional groups involved in city building and hazard mitigation.","Hazards; Remedial action; Terrorism; Urban areas","Adaptive systems; Disasters; Earthquakes; Education; Environmental impact; Floods; Hurricane effects; Mathematical models; Personnel training; Public policy; Societies and institutions; Telecommunication systems; Earthquake fault zones; Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); Remedial action; Terrorism; Urban areas; Urban planning","Beatley T., The vision of sustainable communities, Cooperating with Nature: Confronting Natural Hazards with Land-use Planning for Sustainable Communities, pp. 233-262, (1998); Bell M., The five principles of organizational resilience, Gartner Newsletter, (2002); Berke P., Natural-hazard reduction and sustainable development: A global assessment, J.

As a result the dramatic urbanisation process is depleting the world's resources and the chief culprit behind climate change. Resilient cities can adapt to changes, grand challenges and can balance ecosystem and human functions. Spatial planning aims at making cities more resilient and sustainable which requires innovation, foresight, effective partnership and networks among all actors involved in urban planning processes. In practice, the implementation of these ideas is difficult because cities are dynamic structures and spatial planning processes as well as their outputs are very diverse across Europe and the world. Harmonised spatial planning information and spatial data infrastructures (SDI) encourage monitoring and more transparent planning processes. SDI can be a supportive element for spatial planning processes as it provides important harmonised data input and helps to better understand the complexity of cities and planning. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","data harmonisation; resilient cities; SDI; spatial planning; sustainability","Climate change; Climate change; Sustainable development; data harmonisation; Data input; Dynamic structure; Grand Challenge; One step; Planning process; resilient cities; SDI; Spatial data infrastructure; Spatial planning; Urban areas; Dynamic structure; Grand Challenge; Harmonisation; Planning process; resilient cities; Spatial data infrastructure; Spatial planning; Urban areas; Urban planning; Urban planning","Barnett, Et al., Urban Resilience, Research Prospectus, A Resilience Alliance Initiative for Transitioning Urban Systems Towards Sustainable Features, (2007); Beyer C., Wasserburger W., Plan4all Deliverable 2.2, Analysis of Innovative Challenges, (2009); Berkes P., Folke C., Linking Social and Ecological Practices and Social Mechanisms for Building Resilience, (1998); Cerba O., Et al., Conceptual data models for selected themes, Plan4all Deliverable 4.2, (2010); European Regional/Spatial Planning Charter, (1983); Delgado J., Valcarcel Sanz N., Diagnostic report, HLANDATA Deliverable 1.1, (2010); Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of March 14, 2007 Establishing An Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE); Furst D., Regionalplanung im System gesellschaftlicher Steuerung, Zukunftsaufgabe Regionalplanung.

The SPIn-Eco project is a triennial research program with the purpose of assessing the environmental conditions of the Province of Siena (Tuscany, central Italy) and its 36 municipalities. It is a deep analysis of the state of the territorial system by a complete set of instruments and indicators. This paper shows the aggregated results of the analysis for the northern area of the Province of Siena, called Val d'Elsa, which is composed by 6 municipalities. The area is characterised by variegated geomorphology, environmental aspects and urbanization. At the same time, each municipality is traditionally inclined to the development of some activities: agriculture, industry, craft, tourism respectively. The paper presents an environmental assessment of the use of resources at a local level by using some methodologies and sustainability indicators: emergy evaluation (introduced by Howard Odum), greenhouse gas inventory (according to the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories) and ecological footprint analysis (introduced by M. Wackernagel and W. Rees). The discussion section deals with the environmental, social and economic aspects of these under a sustainable perspective. We believe that the distribution of different peculiarities on the territory could be emphasized as a sort of ""anthropic (or urban) resilience"" of the system by a correct territorial planning activity towards sustainability.","Ecological footprint; Emergy evaluation; Greenhouse gases inventory; Indicators; Resilience; Sustainable development","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-4644359238"

In fact, it is unclear exactly what the catchword «resilient city» means. Based on these assumptions, this article reviews resilience perspectives and their possible application to urban systems. In the first part of the paper, the concept of resilience, its evolution and perspectives (from engineering to social ecology) are analyzed with reference to ecosystems, societies and complex systems. In the second part we try to shed light on this panacea of concepts applied to cities. Important insights of this review are that certain resilience engineering perspectives (such as recovery and persistence views) can lead to unsustainable patterns of development in cities, while from complex systems resilience perspectives the principles of sustainability and transformability emerge as the consequent and necessary trajectory. While the term «resilient cities» often refers only to the capacity to maintain functions and structures, we argue that urban resilience should be framed within the resilience (system persistence), transition (system incremental change) and transformation (system reconfiguration) views.","Adaptation to climate change; Resilient cities; Sustainability; Transition towns; Urban resilience","adaptive management; climate change; conceptual framework; sustainability; urban system","Adger N., Social and Ecological Resilience: Are They Related?, Progress in Human Geography, 24, pp. 347-364, (2000); Alberti M., Advances in Urban Ecology: Integrating Humans and Ecological Processes in Urban Ecosystems, (2008); Andersson E., Urban landscapes and sustainable cities, Ecology and Society, 11, 1, (2006); Avallone E., Baumeister III.

However, this notion that cities should persist or be resilient was by no means taken for granted in earlier times. The fact that cities could fall, could vanish entirely or be moved to be rebuilt elsewhere was an accepted notion in many parts of the pre-modern world. Partly this derives from a world-view more intimately aware of the mortality and vulnerability of the human body. Many early religions emphasized the fleeting nature of life and the existence of suffering (whatever its cause) and the possibility of any kind of reconciliation with this world only possible through some form of acceptance, referred to in the Tao-Te-Ching of ancient China as wu wei (lit. no action) (Lao Tzu, 1963). The prevalence of the acceptance of change can be seen not just in Taoism but also in Indian Hinduism and Buddhism and in the pre-Socratic philosophers in ancient Greece, particularly Heraclitus. If change is regarded as the fundamental nature of the world, then attempts to ‘fix’ anything can only be temporary. © 2009, Jon Coaffee, David Murakami Wood and Peter Rogers.","City Wall; Devastate Earthquake; Early Modern Period; Mediaeval Period; Twelfth Century","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144716868"

Design/methodology/ approach: The paper examines the challenges underpinning the problem of environmental degradation in cities. It then briefly considers available initiatives that can be implemented toward the realization of more sustainable cities. A case is made for the possible contribution of the UNESCO biosphere reserve concept as a useful urban management tool. Findings: Urban administrators have a range of tools to select from to support the design and management of sustainable cities. It is argued that the UNESCO biosphere reserve concept is potentially a very valuable tool, although, apart from academic studies, not truly tested in an urban context. Originality/value: Biological diversity is the very essence that sustains life on earth and forms the basis of quality living conditions, even within built-up areas. Today, cities are facing the pressures of increasing populations and the effects thereof on the environment. The challenge facing cities is how to improve the quality of life of all city dwellers amidst the environmental challenge of dwindling natural resources. The paper looks at a number of initiatives available to city administrators in their quest to create liveable cities. It is perhaps timeous to research the potential applicability of the biosphere reserve framework as an urban tool toward more resilient, environmentally acceptable urban landscapes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environmental management; Sustainable development; Urban regions","","Alfsen-Norodom C., Boehme S.E., Clemants S., Corry M., Imbruce V., Lane B.D., Miller R.B., Padoch C., Panero M., Peters C.M., Rosenzweig C., Solecki W., Walsh D., Managing the megacity for global sustainability: The New York metropolitan region as an urban biosphere reserve, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1023, pp. 125-141, (2004); Aquilar A.G., Ward P.M., Globalization, regional development, and mega-city expansion in Latin America: Analyzing Mexico City's peri-urban hinterland, Cities, 20, 1, pp. 3-21, (2003); Beall J., Globalization and social exclusion in cities.

Early ideas on implementing sustainability focused on concepts of achieving stability, practicing effective management and the control of change and growth - a "" fail-safe"" mentality. More recent thinking about change, disturbance, uncertainty, and adaptability is fundamental to the emerging science of resilience, the capacity of systems to reorganize and recover from change and disturbance without changing to other states - in other words, systems that are "" safe to fail."" While the concept of resilience is intellectually intriguing, it remains largely unpracticed in contemporary urban planning and design. This essay discusses the theory of resilience as it applies to urban conditions, and offers a suite of strategies intended to build urban resilience capacity: multifunctionality, redundancy and modularization, (bio and social) diversity, multi-scale networks and connectivity, and adaptive planning and design. The strategies are discussed in the context of resilience theory and sustainability science, and are illustrated with innovative policies, projects, and programs selected from international examples. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive planning and design; Non-equilibrium; Resilience; Sustainability","Modular construction; Adaptive planning; Effective management; Multifunctionality; Non equilibrium; Planning and design; Resilience; Sustainability science; Urban conditions; adaptive management; disturbance; strategic approach; sustainability; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis; urban design; urban planning; Sustainable development","Ahern J., Planning and design for sustainable and resilient cities: theories, strategies and best practices for green infrastructure, Water-centric Sustainable Communities, pp. 135-176, (2010); Botkin D., Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the Twenty-first Century, (1990); Clark W.C., Dickson N.M., Sustainability science: the emerging research program, Proc.

After September 11 in particular, resilience has become an increasingly central organizing metaphor within the policy-making process and in the expanding institutional framework of national security and disaster preparedness and mitigation. As it has evolved, resilience has begun to infiltrate a host of additional, more loosely connected, social and economic policies. This growth in importance has been underpinned by the political prioritization of the safety and security of communities against an array of perceived hazards and threats, including terrorism, disease pandemic and global warming-related flooding. These priorities have been focused on cities because of the particular vulnerability of densely populated political, economic and cultural centres. © 2009, Jon Coaffee, David Murakami Wood and Peter Rogers.","City Wall; Disaster Preparedness; Governmentality Theory; Terrorist Attack; Urban Resilience","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144714206"

We propose that urban agriculture has three elements: urban agriculture in isolation; its interface with the people and environment within which it is situated; and its contribution to the design of built form. Additionally, we consider its scale: micro, meso and macro. The analysis draws attention to legal, social and economic constraints and opportunities. It suggests that future priorities for research should be directed towards (i) strategically identifying principles of sustainable urban agriculture that help policy makers to design resilient cities, e.g. using flood-prone areas for food and employment, and (ii) operationally trialling innovative institutional mechanisms, e.g. differential land taxes to support sustainable urban agriculture or payments for environmental services provided by urban agriculture such as carbon sequestration. © 2010 Earthscan.","Economic; Institutions; Legal; Resilience; Scale; Social","carbon sequestration; economic impact; ecosystem resilience; environmental impact; legal system; policy approach; social impact; sustainability; urban agriculture","Afrane A.A., Klinkenberg E., Drechsel P., Owusu-Daaku K., Garms R., Kruppa T., Does irrigated urban agriculture influence the transmission of malaria in the city of Kumasi, Ghana?, Acta Tropica, 89, 2, pp. 125-134, (2004); Akbari H., Shade trees reduce building energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from power plants, Environmental Pollution, 116, (2002); Allen L.H., Interventions for micronutrient deficiency control in developing countries: past, present and future, Journal of Nutrition, 133, (2003); Alterman R., The challenge of farmland preservation, Lessons from a six-nation comparison, Journal of the American Planning Association, 63, pp. 220-243, (1997); Amoah P., Drechsel P., Abaidoo R.C., Ntow W.J., Pesticide and pathogen contamination of vegetables in Ghanas urban markets, Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, 50, 1, pp. 1-6, (2006); Armstrong D., A survey of community gardens in upstate New York: implications for health promotion and community development, Health and Place, 6, 4, pp. 319-327, (2000); Brady E., The aesthetics of agricultural landscapes and the relationship between humans and nature, Ethics, Place & Environment, 9, pp. 1-19, (2006); Brandenburg A., Carroll M., Your place or mine?

The notion of resilience encompasses pre-disaster planning and warning systems, emergency handling procedures and post-disaster reconstruction. Both human and physical systems are involved at all stages. The success of resilience programmes relies on the cooperation of floodplain populations - for example, increasing the installation of structural flood-resistant and resilient features requires significant commitment from property owners. Knowledge of common features of floodplain populations can therefore aid understanding of the ways in which such cooperation can be achieved. A review of international literature relating to flood proofing of homes and the attitudes of floodplain residents reveals that there are many barriers to overcome in encouraging the installation of resilient measures. Many of these barriers are common across surveyed populations: any proposed scheme must contend with informational barriers, emotional constraints, aesthetic considerations and timing issues. Other barriers depend on local circumstances, finance and regulatory regimes. Lessons can be learned from successful schemes that have overcome some or all of these problems if care is exercised in interpreting the scheme benefits in relation to the identified barriers. © © 2009 Thomas Telford Ltd 2009.","Floods & floodworks; Government; Social impact","Banks (bodies of water); Disaster prevention; Disasters; Flood control; Emergency handling; Flood management; Government; International comparison; Post-disaster reconstruction; Pre-disaster planning; Regulatory regime; Social impact; flooding; floodplain; globalization; hazard management; literature review; social impact; state role; urban region; Floods","Lessons Learned Autumn 2000 Floods, (2001); Ruck M., Signifi Cant Natural Catastrophes in 2005, (2005); Doe R.K., Extreme precipitation and run-off induced fl ash fl ooding at Boscastle, Journal of Meteorology, 29, 293, pp. 7-21, (2004); Werrity A., Houston D., Ball T., Tavendale A., Black A.R., Exploring the Social Impacts of Flood Risk and Flooding in Scotland.

What constitutes life safety began with the goal that occupants have a reasonable chance of being safe inside a building during the earthquake and are able to exit on their own afterwards. Resilience requires a complete set of transparent performance goals that declare what is needed from both the lifeline systems and the buildings to facilitate recovery. The federal government should take the lead in establishing goals needed for recovery along with incentives to adopt and implement them. The federal government needs to set performance standards that can be embedded in the design codes, provide financial incentives to stimulate mitigation that benefits the nation, and continue to support research that delivers new technologies that minimize the cost of mitigation, response and recovery. The City and County of San Francisco has launched a comprehensive recovery planning initiative comprised of 75 different projects aimed at improving the City's ability to recover. The overarching benefit of the shift from safety to resilience is the ability of communities to take the hit of a natural disaster in stride and recover to a new though recognizable normal without loss of life, their economies, jobs, or cultural heritage.","","Civil engineering; Engineering geology; Tsunamis; Comprehensive recovery; Cultural heritages; Design codes; Federal governments; Financial incentives; Life safety; Loss of life; Natural disasters; Natural hazard; Performance standards; San Francisco; Seismic safety; Recovery","Achieving National Disaster Resilience Through Local, Regional, and National Activities, (2010); ASCE/SEI 31-03: Seismic Evaluation of Existing Buildings, (2002); ASCE/SEI 41-06: Seismic Rehabilitation of Existing Buildings, (2007); ASCE/SEI 7-05: Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures, (2010); Chakos A., Seismic risk reduction sparks community resilience, 14th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, (2008); Carl-Henry G., California Earthquakes: Science, Risk, and the Politics of Hazard Mitigation, (2001); The Resilient City, Part 1: Before the disaster, SPUR 0209 Urbanist, (2009); Performance Based Seismic Engineering of Buildings, Vision 2000 Report, (1995)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867186045"

Climate change is increasing the pressures on many urban systems and adding to this complexity. Many of the case studies investigating urban dynamics in the light of climate change have chosen narrow, sector-specific approaches. Few projects have built on insights from complexity theory and related bodies of knowledge which are more consistent with the perspective that urban infrastructure systems are tightly coupled with one another and must respond to often subtle, long-term changes of technological, social and environmental conditions. Drawing on that knowledge, and building on insights from previous case studies, this article explores the potential roles of complexity theory in guiding investment and policy decisions in the urban context. Policy and management that are consistent with insights from complexity theory will need to anticipate a wide array of potential trajectories for urban dynamics, identify and implement strategies that are robust under a range of potential developments, continuously innovate the policy-making and management institutions, and intensify the exchange of knowledge between science and society. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation; Adaptive management; Cities; Climate change; Complex systems; Environmental impact; Infrastructure; Public policy; Urban resilience","climate change; complexity; environmental conditions; knowledge; policy implementation; policy making; social change; technological change; urban climate; urban policy","Allen P.M., Cities and Regions as Self-organizing Systems: Models of Complexity, (1997); Arthur W.B., Competing technologies, increasing returns, and lock-in by historical events, Economic Journal, 99, 394, pp. 116-131, (1989); Report Card for America's Infrastructure, American Society of Civil Engineers, (2005); Barrett J., Vallack H., Jones A., Haq G., A Material Flow Analysis and Ecological Footprint of York, (2002); Batty M., Cities and Complexity: Understanding Cities with Cellular Automata, Agent-based Models, and Fractals, (2005); Bentivegna V., Curwell S., Deakin M., Lombardi P., Mitchell G., Nijkamp P., A vision and methodology for integrated sustainable urban development, Building Research and Information, 30, 2, pp. 83-94, (2002); Island State: An Ecological Footprint Analysis of the Isle of Wight, (2000); Black D., Henderson V., The theory of urban growth, Journal of Political Economy, 107, 2, pp. 252-284, (1999); Bloomfield J., Smith M., Thompson N., Hot Nights in the City: Global Warming, Sea-Level Rise and the New York Metropolitan Region, (1999); Bond R., Lessons for the Large-scale Application of Process Approaches from Sri Lanka, (1998); Brenner N., The urban question: Reflections on Henri Lefebvre, urban theory and the politics of scale, 1International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 24, 2, (2000); Camagni R., Capello R., Nijkamp P., Towards sustainable city policy: an economy: Environment technology nexus, Ecological Economics, 24, 1, pp. 103-118, (1998); CitiesPlus, (2005); Cohen B., Urban growth in developing countries: A review of current trends and a caution regarding existing forecasts, World Development, 32, 1, pp. 23-51, (2004); Curwell S.R., Deakin M., Sustainable urban development and BEQUEST, Building Research and Information, 30, 2, pp. 79-82, (2002); Davison R., Vogel D., Harris R., Jones N., Technology leapfrogging in developing countries: An inevitable luxury?, Electronic Journal on Information Systems in Developing Countries, 1, 5, pp. 1-10, (2000); Dear M.J., Dishman J.D., From Chicago to L.A.: Making Sense of Urban Theory, (2002); SimCity Societies, (2005); Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development: The City of Tomorrow and Cultural Heritage, (2006); Europe's Environment: The Second Assessment, (1998); National Ecological Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts, 2005, (2005); Forrester J.W., Urban Dynamics, (1969); Fujita M., Krugman P., Venables A.J., The Spatial Economy, Cities, Regions, and International Trade, (1999); Funtowicz S.O., Ravetz J.R., A new scientific methodology for global environmental issues, Ecological Economics: The Science and Management of Sustainability, (1991); Golob T.F., Regan A.C., Impacts of information technology on personal travel and commercial vehicle operations: Research challenges and opportunities, Transportation Research, Part C—Emerging Technologies, 9, pp. 87-121, (2001); Graham S., Marvin S., Telecommunications and the City, (1996); Gunderson L., Holling C.S., Light S., Barriers and Bridges to the Renewal of Ecosystems and Institutions, (1995); Guy S., Managing water stress: The logic of demand side infrastructure planning, Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 39, 1, pp. 123-130, (1996); Healey P., Urban Complexity and Spatial Strategies: Towards a Relational Planning for Our Times, (2007); Holling C.S., Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management, (1978); Holman I.P., Rounsevell M.D.A., Shackley S., Harrison P.A., Nicholls R.J., Berry P.M., Audsley E., A regional, multi-sectoral and integrated assessment of the impacts of climate and socio-economic change in the UK.

The focus is on three main aspects of post-disaster urban reconstruction: sociospatial coherence, temporal continuity, and multistakeholder integration and communication. Critical interpretation of the government-guided reconstruction reveals that reconstruction was limited to the generic production and implementation of top-down planning. From the perspective of urban resilience, and through an alternative design scenario developed in this research, this article highlights an urban resilience design framework based on post-disaster development in the Sichuan city of Dujiangyan. By identifying the deficiencies of the governmental reconstruction where in many aspects resilience has not been considered, and by proposing the alternative where resilience has been considered to develop a better living, this research seeks to integrate urban resilience as a key aspect in the Sichuan reconstruction and as essential for developing the post-disaster city towards a more coherent, sustainable, and integral urban future. © 2012, The Author(s).","design for urban resilience; Dujiangyan; Great Sichuan Earthquake; post-disaster reconstruction","","Bull-Kamanga L., Diagne K., Lavell A., Leon F., Lerise F., Mac-Gregor H., From Everyday Hazards to Disasters: The Accumulation of Risk in Urban Areas, Environment and Urbanization, 15, 1, pp. 193-204, (2003); Carpenter S., Walker B., Anderies J.M., Abel N., From Metaphor to Measurement: Resilience of What to What?, Ecosystems, 4, pp. 765-781, (2001); Coaffee J., Wood D.M., Rogers P., The Everyday Resilience of the City, How Cities Respond to Terrorism and Disaster, (2009); Dovers S.R., Handmer J.W., Uncertainty, Sustainability and Change, Global Environmental Change, 2, 4, pp. 262-276, (1992); Ge Y., Gu Y.T., Deng W.G., Evaluating China’s National Post-Disaster Plans: The 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake’s Recovery and Reconstruction Planning, International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, 1, 2, pp. 17-27, (2010); Godschalk D.R., Urban Hazard Mitigation: Creating Resilient Cities, Natural Hazards Review, 4, 3, pp. 136-143, (2003); Goldstein B.E., Collaborative Resilience: Moving Through Crisis to Opportunity, (2011); Gunderson L.H., Ecological Resilience — In Theory and Application, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, pp. 425-439, (2000); Guo Y., Integralism: From a Post-Disaster City towards the Tourbanistic Agropolis of Dujiangyan, Sichuan, European Postgraduate Master in Urbanism, (2010); Holling C.S., Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 4, pp. 1-23, (1973); Kuang X., Jiang J., 60 Years of China’s Urbanization: 1949–2009, Urban China, 40, (2010); Lin M., Zhan J., NGO Involvement and Management in Post-disaster Relief, Administrative Management of China No, (2010); Pelling M., The Vulnerability of Cities: Natural Disasters and Social Resilience, (2003); Pelling M., High C., Understanding Adaptation: What Can Social Capital Offer Assessments of Adaptive Capacity?, Global Environmental Change, 15, 4, pp. 308-319, (2005); Potangaroa R., Wang M.J., 2008 Y.C., Identifying Resilience in Those Affected by the, 2008, (2008); Post-Wenchuan Earthquake Restoration and Reconstruction Ordinance (No, (2008); Timmerman P., Vulnerability, Resilience and the Collapse of Society: A Review of Models and Possible Climatic Applications, (1981); Vale L.J., Campanella T.J., The Resilient City: How Modern Cities Recover from Disaster, (2005)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883796365"

Impacts are, however, associated with substantial uncertainties. This paper studies an uncertainty-robust adaptation strategy: strengthening the resilience of the impacted system. This approach is operationalised for the city of Rotterdam, using literature study, interviews, and a workshop. Potential impacts have been explored using national climate statistics and scenarios and a set of 'wildcards' (imaginable surprises). Sea level rise, particularly in combination with storm surge, and enduring heat and drought are the most relevant potential stresses in the area. These can lead to damage, loss of image, and societal disruption. Unclear responsibilities enhance disruption. 'Resilience principles' made the concept of resilience sufficiently operational for local actors to explore policy options. Useful principles for urban resilience include: homeostasis, omnivory, high flux, flatness, buffering, redundancy, foresight and preparedness/planning, compartmentalisation, and flexible planning/design. A resilience approach makes the system less prone to disturbances, enables quick and flexible responses, and is better capable of dealing with surprises than traditional predictive approaches. Local actors frame resilience as a flexible approach to adaptation that would be more suitable and tailored to local situations than rigid top-down regulations. In addition to a change in policy, it would require a more pro-active mentality among the population. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change adaptation; Resilience; Resilience principles; Uncertainty; Urban planning","Netherlands; Rotterdam; South Holland; Laws and legislation; Population statistics; Sea level; Urban planning; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Climate statistics; Coastal cities; High flux; Omnivory; Planning/Design; Policy options; Potential impacts; Potential stress; Rotterdam; Sea level rise; Storm surges; Topdown; Uncertain climate; Urban resilience; climate change; coping strategy; policy strategy; resilience; top-down approach; uncertainty role; urban planning; Climate change","Impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. contribution of working group II to the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), (2007); Smith S.J., Wigley T.M.L., Nakicenovic N., Raper S.C.B., Climate implications of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, Technol.

This project has been the locus of significant remote sensing investigation and characterization of the Phoenix urban and peri-urban areas (Stefanov 2002), combined with ground truthing and allied studies (Hope et al. 2003). The information derived from these and other studies is increasingly being used by local governments and regional planners (GP2100 2003). As an example, the City of Scottsdale, Arizona has used high-resolution, airborne, multispectral data to assess impervious and pervious land-cover percentages for surface water runoff studies. This use of remotely sensed information, rather than traditional ground-based surveys, produced estimated cost savings of eight to fifteen million dollars for the city (W. Erickson 1999). Construction of an advanced visualization and modeling environment (a decision theater) that integrates remotely sensed and other geospatial data for the Phoenix metropolitan region was completed in 2005 at Arizona State University (J. Fink 2005). Use of such an advanced system enables near real-time modeling of the impact of planning and development decisions. Remotely sensed data acquired at a variety of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions provides the basic biophysical information necessary to initialize models of urban resilience and sustainability. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","","Abrams M., The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER): Data products for the high spatial resolution imager on NASA's Terra platform, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 21, pp. 847-859, (2000); Arrowsmith J.R., Stefanov W.L., Geology Overview for the CAP-LTER Region.

Urban planning to minimise adverse impacts of climate change at the city level can establish a climate-resilient city. Mitigation strategies to reduce CO 2 emissions would lead to a climate-friendly city. Integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation into sustainable city planning should not be merely added as a single level of sustainable city planning, but requires a wide range of multi-level cooperation. Lijiang City has experienced climatic change during the last half century, and its CO 2 emissions have increased faster than the GDP growth. Nearby glaciers on Yulong Snow Mountain have been retreating and losing mass since the early twentieth century. In this paper, we identify economic sectors that are vulnerable to climate change, including tourism, agriculture and water supply, and propose mitigation and adaptation strategies to cope with climate change in this tourism city. As energy use is the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy has enormous CO 2 reduction potential. Land use practices, a sectoral approach and public participation are all considered adaptive in climate planning. The proposals outlined are valuable as they provide an understanding of how to implement integrated climate planning and integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation into sustainable city planning. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adaptation; city planning; climate change; mitigation","China; Yulong Snow Mountains; Yunnan; adaptation; agricultural practice; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; integrated approach; renewable resource; sustainable development; town planning; twentieth century; vulnerability","Adger W.N., Dessai S., Goulden M., Are there social limits to adaptation to climate change, Clim.

Examples are provided of trends and challenges impacting the resilience of South Africa's metropolitan regions, as identified in recent empirical studies conducted by the authors.1 The paper argues that the agglomeration challenges facing South Africa's metropolitan regions and complications brought about by intra-metropolitan inequality are key aspects underlying the resilience of these regions. The article also suggests that there might be value in greater collaboration in research and knowledge-production and sharing in metropolitan planning, development and governance, between South African metropolitan regions and those in Central European countries.","Metropolitan inequality; Metropolitan regions; South Africa; Urban resilience","","Alberti M., Marzluff J.M., Shulenberger E., Bradley G., Ryan C., Zumbrunnen C., Integrating humans into ecology: Opportunities and challenges for studying urban ecosystems, BioScience, 53, 12, pp. 1169-1179, (2003); Altrock U., Giintner S., Huning S., Peters D., Spatial Planning and Urban Development in the New EU Member States: From Adjustment to Reinvention, (2006); Amin A., Thrift N.J., Globalization, Institutions, and Regional Development in Europe, (1994); Amin A., Thrift N., Cities: Re-imagining the Urban, (2002); Beall J., Globalization and social exclusion in cities: Framing the debate with lessons from Africa and Asia, Environment and Urbanization, 14, 1, pp. 41-51, (2002); (2009); The Cauldron of Local Protests: Reasons, Impacts and Lessons Learned; Making Cities Work for All: Global Action Plan for City Development Strategies, (2000); City Development Strategies: The Cities Alliance Perspective, (2001); National State of Local Government Assessments Overview Report, (2009); Geospatial Analysis Platform 2006, (2007); Dijkstra L., Regional focus: Metropolitan regions in the EU European, Union Regional Policy, 1, (2009); Integrated Planning Development Modelling Toolkit, (2009); (2005); Faludi A., Now more than ever; The open method of coordination in EU territorial cohesion policy, European Spatial Research and Policy, 24, 1, pp. 11-23, (2007); Gauteng Spatial Development Perspective, (2007); Harrison P., Fragmentation and globalisation as the new meta-narrative, Confronting Fragmentation: Housing and Urban Development in A Democratising Society, (2003); Van Huyssteen E., Biermann S., Naude A., Roux A.L.E., Advances in spatial analysis to support a more nuanced reading of the South African space economy, Urban Forum, 20, pp. 195-214, (2009); Van Huyssteen E., Oranje M.C., Robinson S., Makoni E., South Africa's City regions: A call for contemplation⋯ and action, Urban Forum, 20, pp. 175-195, (2009); MarszaL T., Metropolitan processes in central and Eastern Europe, European Spatial Research and Policy, 15, 2, pp. 27-37, (2008); Meiklejohn C., Coetzee M.J., Integrated development planning, Hologram: The Best of Hologram 2001-2003, (2003); Merrifield A., Oranje M., Fourie C., Dialogue or Control? the Future of Planning in South Africa, (2008); Muller E.N., Democracy, economic development, and income inequality, American Sociological Review, 53, 1, pp. 50-68, (1988); Territorial Reviews: Competitive Cities in the Global Economy, (2006); Regional Development in Poland.

These were primarily developed in order to build up a consistent degree of resilience across the country in order to prepare for, and respond to, a variety of threats faced. Although this has been driven since the 1980s by a concern for Integrated Emergency Management (IEM), and despite the concerns of provincial cities over flooding and the threat of animal disease pandemics to rural areas, it is clear that the threat of terrorism has become the predominant driver at state level. This has enabled emergency planning to enjoy unprecedented funding and profile at all scales. In the last chapter, we explored what this might mean for the everyday life of the city from spatial governance to institutional and personal responsibilization. © 2009, Jon Coaffee, David Murakami Wood and Peter Rogers.","Civil Defence; National Security; Security Governance; Urban Resilience; Violent Extremism","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144642770"

The authors start by setting the scene regarding the challenges the metropolitan areas face in responding to their increasing carbon footprint, dependence on fossil fuels, and impact on the irreplaceable natural resources. The book proceeds by providing many illuminating but shocking figures about how far the increasingly urbanized residents of this planet have traveled down a wrong path. The case for resilient cities is structured upon seven key elements, including the renewable energy city, the carbon neutral city, the distributed city, the sustainable transport city, the photosynthetic city, the place-based city, and the eco-efficient city.","","Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Renewable energy resources; Carbon footprint; Carbon neutrals; Energy crisis; Key elements; Metropolitan area; Peak Oil; Renewable energies; Sustainable transport; Climate change","Beck U., World at Risk, Polity, (2009); Diamond J.M., Collapse: How Societies Choose to Succeed or Fail, (2005); Hubbert M.K., Nuclear energy and the fossil fuels, Spring Meeting of the Southern District Division of Production, (1956); Korhonen J., Seager T.P., Beyond eco-efficiency: A resilience perspective, Business Strategy and the Environment, 17, 7, pp. 411-419, (2008); Smith G., Power for the 21st Century, Earth Island Journal, (2001); Two Billion People Vulnerable to Floods by 2050, (2004)","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77649302447"

But to show my biases up front, I would rephrase it to read, how can archaeologists usefully contribute to public policy considerations on the future of this planet?, or perhaps just modify her question to say, how can archaeologists help save the world? As one looks at recent books such as Newman, Beatley and Boyer's Resilient cities. Responding to peak oil and climate change (2009), Richard Heinberg's The party's over. Oil, war and the fate of industrial societies (2005), or Howard and Elisabeth Odum's A prosperous way down (2001) or key articles such as Ecology in times of scarcity by John Day et al. (2009) or Tracking the ecological overshoot of the human economy by Mathis Wackernagel et al. (2002), it seems clear to me that archaeologists could readily amplify the important arguments mounted by these authors and play a useful role in helping planners confront looming global cultural-ecological issues. It is not that these writers are unaware of archaeology and its potential contributions - Heinberg (2005, 34-38), for example, looks quite favorably on the work of Joseph Tainter - but that archaeological research could be more thoroughly and productively utilized.

Recognizing this role of ecosystems, several international and nongovernmental organizations have promoted an ecosystem-based approach to adaptation. We review the scientific literature related to ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) with forests and trees, and highlight five cases in which forests and trees can support adaptation: (1) forests and trees providing goods to local communities facing climatic threats; (2) trees in agricultural fields regulating water, soil, and microclimate for more resilient production; (3) forested watersheds regulating water and protecting soils for reduced climate impacts; (4) forests protecting coastal areas from climate-related threats; and (5) urban forests and trees regulating temperature and water for resilient cities. The literature provides evidence that EBA with forests and trees can reduce social vulnerability to climate hazards; however, uncertainties and knowledge gaps remain, particularly for regulating services in watersheds and coastal areas. Few studies have been undertaken on EBA specifically, but the abundant literature on ecosystem services can be used to fill knowledge gaps. Many studies assess the multiple benefits of ecosystems for human adaptation or well-being, but also recognize trade-offs between ecosystem services. Better understanding is needed of the efficiency, costs, and benefits, and trade-offs of EBA with forests and trees. Pilot projects under implementation could serve as learning sites and existing information could be systematized and revisited with a climate change adaptation lens. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","Coasts; Commerce; Ecosystems; Forestry; Seasonal Variation; Water Sheds; Climatology; Coastal zones; Commerce; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Forestry; Shore protection; Watersheds; Agricultural fields; Climate change adaptation; Climate variability and change; Ecosystem services; Forested watersheds; Nongovernmental organizations; Scientific literature; Social vulnerability; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; ecosystem service; forest management; Climate change","Parry M.L., Canziani O.F., Palutikof J.P., van der Linden P.J., Hanson C.E., Climate change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

By environmental literature conducted recently, it has been evidently comprehended that urban life quality for mankind and others can be improved by serving these systems with green and living elements. This study is to investigate urban rocky habitats that have special natural characteristics and that can be implicated for urban green areas. But these habitats have been considered as nature splits withstanding against the urban pressures by means of the unplanned build-up activities foremost, and road construction, poor quality or neglected remnants. Therefore, this study presents the environmental perception and preferences of urban rocky habitats which are threatening within excessive urbanization and human use of natural areas in the context of the city of Trabzon, Turkey. So, a total of 20 habitats selected from urban and surroundings were surveyed by using a questionnaire and landscape assessment approach. With surveying performed on 204 participants, visual preferences, landscape attributes and proposed management options for urban nature conservation were determined. The χ2-test results revealed clearly that the demographic and expertise status of the participants were correlated with the preferences for types of rocky habitat scene and management options. The scenes with natural elements and less human disturbance obtained higher scores on visual preferences than any of the urban rocky scenes lacking these characteristics. Also, in the quantitative phase, factor analysis based on principal component structure revealed the 'visual and spatial effects', the 'usage and arrangement', the 'naturalness and ecological value', and the 'functionality' components of the scenes. Consequently, some implications for the effective and efficient planning and development of urban nature conservation by assisting the better understanding of the various patterns of landscape preference, choice and satisfaction in habitats under the present study were suggested. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It also has a rapidly rising population with significant growth expected into the future. This paper analyses Australia's existing infrastructure and urban form, the carbon implications associated with it, along with the resources needed to sustain this way of life. The paper demonstrates how the current design of Australian cities based on large houses in low density, dispersed suburbs, which are highly car dependent is extremely resource and emission intensive and ultimately unsustainable. It is argued that the large scale, centralised management of resources, based on outdated technologies and compounded by aging infrastructure further exacerbates the problem. If Australia continues under this 'business as usual' scenario, an increase in emissions, along with numerous resource concerns can be expected. The authors contend, therefore, that Australia urgently needs to transform its cities to embrace new low carbon designs and more efficient and resilient urban systems and processes to ensure the long-term viability of Australian cities. A new model for cities is thus proposed, which is based around the concept of decentralized management of resources using new, low carbon technologies that appear to function best at the precinct level. These can help to create more integrated and resilient infrastructure systems within our cities that will greatly improve efficiency. The technologies outlined, however, are dependent on the urban form in that they are only effective and economically viable if sufficient density exists. In the case of Australian cities, this would therefore involve increasing the density in many areas, especially new centres. Adding density has numerous other benefits such as enabling better public transport infrastructure, which will reduce car dependency and the related transported emissions. Using density to transform cities can also improve quality of life by offering more local amenities and better lifestyles.","Decarbonising; Decentralised resource management; Density; Green infrastructure","Density (specific gravity); Ferry boats; Aging infrastructure; Australia; Business-as-usual; Decarbonising; Decentralised; Decentralized management; Ecological footprint; Green infrastructure; Infrastructure systems; Long-term viability; Low carbon; Low density; Low-carbon technologies; New model; Per capita; Public transport; Quality of life; Urban form; Urban systems; Population statistics","Chanan A., Kanasamy S., Vigneswaran S., Sharma D., A gradualist approach to address Australia's urban water challenge, Desalination, 249, 3, pp. 1012-1016, (2009); Green Infrastructure for Sydney, (2010); Energy Use in the Australian Residential Sector 1986-2020, (2008); Australia's National Greenhouse Accounts: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Accounting for the Kyoto Target, (2009); National Waste Policy: Fact Sheet, (2010); A Sustainable Population Strategy for Australia: Issues Paper and Appendices, (2010); Crawford R., Treloar G., An assessment of the energy and water embodied in commercial building construction, 4th Australian Life Cycle Assessment Conference, (2005); Dodman D., Blaming cities for climate change?

Most of the active efforts in the Republic of Slovenia were focused towards flood hazard mapping. In this research, the issue of flood vulnerability and flood hazard is addressed in order to systematically reduce flood hazards. In this article, an advanced theoretical approach is presented, which defines flood vulnerability and (in connection to flood risk) provides information on flood hazards. Based upon this, it is possible to define flood hazards in monetary terms. This approach is setting forward special information that is missing from existing public registries, i.e. benchmark data. The article also presents a new concept of flood hazard definition, which is based upon different uses of flood hazard information: rescue and relief measures, optimization and selection of flood hazard mitigation measures, development of individual flood proofing measures, and other. All the listed measures have their spatial dimension, which is also a subject of positioning into space. In this framework, an information of spatial positioning of existing flood hazard and mitigation measures aiming at the reduction of flood hazard is challenged, especially from the point of view of development of documents that define development of specific area.","Flood hazard; Flood management; Flood risk; Flood vulnerability; Mitigation measures; Multiperspective decision making; Types of flood hazard","Slovenia; data processing; decision making; flood control; hazard assessment; mapping; mitigation; optimization; risk assessment; urban area; vulnerability","Banovec P., Analiza Tveganj In Druga Orodja Za Podporo Odločanju, (1999); Banonvec P., Cverle A., Cerk M., Karte Razredov Poplavne Nevarnosti In Poplavne Ogroženosti Za Občino Domžale - Metodologija Za Izdelavo Poplavne Ogroženosti Za Potrebe Sil Varstva Pred Naravnimi In Drugimi Nesrečami, (2011); Banovec P., Steinman F., Poplavne Škode Na Poplavnih Območjih Malega Grabna Pri Visokih Vodah, (2002); Banovec P., Steinman F., Gosar L., Pergar P., Trcek R., Vrednotenje Poplavnih Škod Ter Analiza Preventivnih Ukrepov: Končno Poročilo, (2003); Banovec P., Steinman F., Trcek R., Ocjena Poplavnih Šteta U Dolini Selške Sore I Valorizacija Ekonomskih Efekata Retencija, (2002); Jemec P., Steinman F., Banovec P., Izvrednotenje Poplavnih Škod - Krivulje Nastajanja Poplavne Škode Ob Ujmi 1990 V Celju, (2002); Kupier E., Water Resources Project Economics, (1971); Merz B., Et al., Navodilo O Enotni Metodologiji Za Cenitev Škode, Ki So Jo Povzročile Elementarne Nesreče, pp. 653-712, (2010); pp. 653-712; Statisticniurad R.S., Ocenjene Škode Zaradi Elementarnih Nesreč V Sloveniji V Obdobju 1991 Do 1995, (1999); HEC-FDA User's Manual, (1998); Trcek R., Zadrževalniki Na Selški Sori Za Zmanjšanje Poplavne Škode, (1999); (2010); (1983)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84872304251"

Already the severity of climate-related hazards, especially flooding, is increasing. It is predicted that among the coastal mega-cities Dhaka would be the most vulnerable to climate change. This research measures the existing level of climate disaster resilience of Dhaka City Corporation by assessing the problems and potentialities in different sectors. The Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) was calculated for 10 different zones of Dhaka City Corporation. CDRI analysis comprises five different dimensions (physical, social, economic, institutional and natural), 25 parameters and 125 variables (development issues). Findings show that besides location, the utility services, accessibility to roads, housing and land-use, health, social capital and environmental conditions are each playing a role in determining the resilience level of different zones. It is interesting to note that the planned residential areas have relatively higher levels of climate disaster resilience, while old parts of the city and densely populated low income areas have lower levels of resilience. Dhaka, being the primate city of the country, continuously faces numerous challenges and opportunities. It is expected that by utilizing CDRI results in policy formulation and development planning, these challenges could be minimized and opportunities enhanced, leading to a more resilient city in the future. 2011 Policy Studies Organization.","climate disaster resilience; Dhaka City Corporation; zone","","Alam M., Rabbani M.D.G., Vulnerabilities and Responses to Climate Change for Dhaka, Adapting Cities to Climate Change—Understanding and Addressing the Development Challenges, pp. 93-110, (2009); Cities Without Slums, Climate Migration Drives Slum Growth in Dhaka, (2010); Dhaka Bangladesh, Disaster Risk Management Profile, (2006); Dewan A.M., Yasushi Y., Land Use and Land Cover Change in Greater Dhaka, Bangladesh: Using Remote Sensing to Promote Sustainable Urbanization, Applied Geography, 29, pp. 390-401, (2009); Dewan A.M., Makoto N., Mitsuru K., DEM Based Flood Extent Delineation in Dhaka City, Bangladesh, Journal of the Faculty of Environmental Science and Technology, 19, 1, pp. 99-110, (2004); Dhaka City Corporation Website, (2010); Faisal I.M., Kabir M.R., Nishat A., The Disastrous Flood of 1998 and Long Term Mitigation Strategies for Dhaka City, Natural Hazards, 28, pp. 85-99, (2003); Hossain S., Rapid Urban Growth and Poverty in Dhaka City, Bangladesh e-Journal of Sociology, 5, 1, pp. 1-24, (2008); Hossain S., Rapid Mass Urbanization and its Social Consequences in Bangladesh: The Case of the Megacity of Dhaka, Paper presented at 16th Biennial Conference of the Asian Studies Association of Australia in Wollongong, June 26–29, 2006, (2006); Huq S., Mozaharul A., Flood Management and Vulnerability of Dhaka City, Building Safer Cities: The Future of Disaster Risk, Disaster Risk Management, pp. 121-135, (2003); Environment and Disaster Risk-Emerging Perspective, (2010); Hyogo Framework for Action 2005–2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters, (2007); Islam N., Dhaka in 2025 A.D, Dhaka Past, Present, Future, pp. 608-621, (2009); Islam N., Mahbub A.Q.M., Islam N.N., Urban Slums of Bangladesh, Daily Star, June 20, 2009, (2009); Joerin J., Rajib S., Mapping Climate and Disaster Resilience in Cities, Climate Disaster Resilience in Cities, Community, Environment and Disaster Risk Management, 6, pp. 47-61, (2011); Klein R.J.T., Nicholls R.J., Frank T., Resilience to Natural Hazards: How Useful is this Concept, Environmental Hazards, 5, 1-2, pp. 35-45, (2003); Michael H., Svarin D., Environmental Pressure and Rural-Urban Migration: The Case of Bangladesh, (2009); Morshed M., Ara G.P., Need and Consequences: Real Estate Development in Dhaka City, Bangladesh, Presented at International Urban Planning and Environment Association (IUPEA) 8th International Symposium, March 23–26, 2009, Kaiserslautern, Germany, (2009); Published by Disaster Management Bureau, Ministry of Food and Disaster Management, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, (2008); Parvin G.A., Jonas J., Sunil P., Rajib S., Climate and Disaster Resilience Mapping at Microlevel of Cities, Climate Disaster Resilience in Cities, Community, Environment and Disaster Risk Management, 6, pp. 103-127, (2011); Rabbani M.D.G., Environmental Risks in Dhaka: Present Initiatives and the Future Improvements, Urban Risk Reduction: An Asian Perspective, pp. 319-338, (2009); Rahmananisur Md, Dhaka's Peripheral Development and Vulnerability to Earthquake Liquefaction Effects, Asian Disaster Management News, 16, 1, pp. 6-7, (2010); Razafindrabe B.H.N., Et al., Climate Disaster Resilience: Focus on Coastal Urban Cities in Asia, Asian Journal of Environment and Disaster Management, 1, 1, pp. 101-116, (2009); Roy M., Planning for Sustainable Urbanization in Fast Growing Cities: Migration and Adaptation Issues Addressing in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Habitat International, 33, 3, pp. 276-286, (2009); Roy S.G., Abdullah A.Q.M., Assessing Needs and Scope of Upgrading Urban Squatters in Bangladesh, BRAC University Journal, II, 1, pp. 33-41, (2005); Satterthwaite D., David D., Jane B., Conclusions: Local Development and Adaptation, Adapting Cities to Climate Change-Understanding and Addressing the Development Challenges, pp. 359-383, (2009); Shahid S., Houshang B., Drought Risk Assessment in the Western Part of Bangladesh, Natural Hazards, 46, 3, pp. 391-413, (2008); Shaw R., Yukiko T., Jonas J., Chennai Zone Profile, Climate and Disaster Resilience, (2010); Dhaka City—State of Environment 2005.

Based on a variety of historical examples, I argue that urban resilience is largely a function of resilient and resourceful citizens. Hurricane Katrina not only devastated the built environment of New Orleans but, by forcing a massive evacuation of residents, tore apart its social fabric as well. I maintain that plans to rebuild the physical infrastructure of the city must be accompanied by a commitment to rehabilitate its social fabric and communal networks. Only with strong citizen involvement at the grassroots level will the rebuilding of New Orleans yield a robust and inclusive metropolis, rather than a theme-park shadow of its former self. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Louisiana; New Orleans; North America; United States; infrastructure planning; natural disaster; urban planning; urban population; urban renewal","Anderson M., The federal bulldozer, (1964); Campo-Flores A., A new spice in the gumbo, Newsweek, (2005); Cecelski D.S., Tyson T.B., Democracy betrayed: The Wilmington race riot of 1898 and its legacy, (1998); Dart B., City left to the dead: Thousands flee, but uncounted corpses remain, Atlanta Constitution, (2005); Davis D.E., Reverberations: Mexico City's 1985 earthquake and the transformation of the capital, The resilient city: How modern cities recover from disaster, pp. 225-280, (2005); Davis M., Gentrifying disaster, (2005); Fulton W., After the unrest, The resilient city: How modern cities recover from disaster, pp. 229-312, (2005); Garreau J., A sad truth: Cities aren't forever, Washington Post, (2005); Godschalk D., Viewpoint: Mitigate, mitigate, mitigate, Planning, 71, 10, (2005); Gotham K.F., A city without slums: Urban renewal, public housing and downtown revitalization in Kansas City, Missouri, American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 60, 1, pp. 285-316, (2001); Hall P., Cities of tomorrow, (1988); Hamilton B., Home” has new meaning: Vietnamese vow to rebuild N.O. enclave, Times-Picayune, (2005); Hauser C., Sustained by close ties, Vietnamese toil to rebuild, New York Times, (2005); Kirschbaum J.B., Sideroff D., A delayed healing: Understanding the fragmented resilience of Gernika, The resilient city: How modern cities recover from disaster, pp. 159-179, (2005); Page S., Evacuees shun going home, (2005); Roberts R., It was just like Beverly Hills, Riverfront Times, (2005); Rodriguez G., La Nueva Orleans, (2005); Sheffi Y., The resilient enterprise, (2005); Tung A., Preserving the worlďs great cities, (2001); Data for the State of Louisiana, (2000); Vale L., Campanella T., The resilient city: How modern cities recover from disaster, (2005)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33745430748"

We propose that urban agriculture has three elements: urban agriculture in isolation; its interface with the people and environment within which it is situated; and its contribution to the design of built form. Additionally, we consider its scale: micro, meso and macro. The analysis draws attention to legal, social and economic constraints and opportunities. It suggests that future priorities for research should be directed towards (i) strategically identifying principles of sustainable urban agriculture that help policy makers to design resilient cities, e.g. using flood-prone areas for food and employment, and (ii) operationally trialling innovative institutional mechanisms, e.g. differential land taxes to support sustainable urban agriculture or payments for environmental services provided by urban agriculture such as carbon sequestration. © 2010 Earthscan.

This article lays a foundation for discussing transitions in urban governance, which enable cities to navigate change, build capacity to withstand shocks, and use experimentation and innovation in face of uncertainty. Using the three concrete case cities New Orleans, Cape Town, and Phoenixthe article analyzes thresholds and cross-scale interactions, and expands the scale at which urban resilience has been discussed by integrating the idea from geography that cities form part of ""system of cities"" (i.e., they cannot be seen as single entities). Based on this, the article argues that urban governance need to harness social networks of urban innovation to sustain ecosystem services, while nurturing discourses that situate the city as part of regional ecosystems. The article broadens the discussion on urban resilience while challenging resilience theory when addressing human-dominated ecosystems. Practical examples of harnessing urban innovation are presented, paired with an agenda for research and policy. © 2010 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Cape Town; Cross-scale interactions; Ecosystem services; New Orleans; Phoenix; Social-ecological processes; Urban innovation; Urban resilience","Arizona; Ecosystem; Humans; Louisiana; South Africa; Urbanization; Arizona; Cape Town; Louisiana; New Orleans; Phoenix; South Africa; United States; Western Cape; Harness; climate change; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem service; governance approach; human activity; innovation; migratory population; social network; urbanization; article; ecosystem; human; South Africa; United States; urbanization","Whyte I.J., Van Aarde R.J., Pimm.

These circumstances oblige us to manage flood risk by integrating new concepts like urban resilience design. Definitively, our goal is to reduce flood risk by managing vulnerability issues of flooded areas to achieve flood resilient cities. A first analysis of city needs of decision-making tools showed that no tools to prioritize recovery actions are available. This tool needs to integrate some models and indicators to be efficient: an urban systemic model of the city; resilience indicators; failure and recovery scenarios. A first prototype sketch was designed but it needs to integrate these models and indicators. That is why, as part of a future PhD thesis, this tool will be developed to be used directly by decision makers and communities. © 2010 WIT Press.","GIS; Indicators; Resilience; Safety methods; Urban networks; Urban systemic model","France; conference proceeding; decision support system; flood control; GIS; urban design; urban planning","Szollosi-Nagy A., Zevenbergen C., Urban flood management, Introduction, pp. 1-10, (2005); Climate change, The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Summary for Policymakers, (2007); FRG Overview; Ashley R., Blanksby J., Chapman J., Zhou J.J., Towards integrated approaches to reduced flood risk in urban areas, Advances in Urban Flood Management, pp. 415-432, (2007); Nie L.M., Lindholm O., Braskerud B.C., Urban flood management in a changing climate, J. of Water by Norwegian Water Association, 2, pp. 203-213, (2009); Ledoux B., La Gestion du Risque Inundation, (2005); Wilhite D.A., The role of the government in planning for drought: Where do we go from here?, Planning for Drought: Toward in Societal Vulnerability, pp. 425-444, (1987); Hooke W.H., U.S. participation in international decade for natural disaster reduction, Natural Hazards Review, pp. 106-133, (2000); Fontaine M.M., Steinemann A.C., Assessing vulnerability to natural hazards: Impact-based method and application to drought in Washington state, Natural Hazards Review, pp. 11-17, (2009); Rose A., Porter K., Dash N., Bouabid J., Huyck C., Whitehead J., Shaw D., Eguchi R., Taylor C., McLane T., Thomas Tobin L., Ganderton P.T., Godschalk D., Kiremidjian A.S., Tierney K., West C.T., Benefit cost analysis of FEMA hazard mitigation grants, Natural Hazards Review, pp. 97-110, (2007); Dauphine A., Provitolo D., La résilience: un concept pour la gestion des risques, Annales de Géographie, 654, pp. 115-125, (2007); Folke C., Resilience and sustainable development: Building adaptive capacity in a world of transformation, Environmental Advisory Council to the Swedish Government, (2002); Gunderson L.H., Holling C.S., Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems, (2002); McManus S., Seville E., Vargo J., Brunsdon D., Facilitated process for improving organizational resilience, ASCE, Natural Hazards Review, pp. 81-90, (2008); Pumain D., La Dynamique des Villes, (1982); Pumain D., Sanders L., Saint-Julien T., Villes et auto-organisation, Economica, (1995); Sanders L., Système de Villes et synergétique, Anthropos-Economica, (1992); Beaujeu-Garnier J., Géographie Urbaine, (1997); Berry B.J.L., Cities As Systems Within Systems of Cities, pp. 147-163, (1964); Etude Préalable À la Réduction de la Vulnérabilité des Réseaux Liée Aux Inondations en Loire Moyenne, (2006); Modarres M., What Every Engineer Should Know about Reliability and Risk Analysis, (1993); Hartford.

This paper considers the meaning of this globally manifest, yet regionally differentiated, ecological threat for Australia's urban system. It also considers the twin ecological peril of oil depletion, whose impacts may intensify to great effect the social stresses likely to emerge as climates warm. The paper intervenes in the debate that transfixes contemporary Australian urbanism: the sustainability of the suburban form in which most Australians live. A similar if not identical debate exists in North America and parts of western Europe. These discussions may be overemphasising the environmental significance of urban form and failing to apprehend the deeper socio-cultural forces that drive the (over)consumption of nature. Planning thought and practice need to loosen the grip of physical determinism on their environmental comprehension if they are to comprehend accurately the sources of, and solutions to, ecological threat. New urban scientific evidence suggests that planning's principal role in the fight against warming will be one of adaptation not mitigation. That is to say, there is no simple 'spatial fix' for overconsumption. © 2008 Urban Studies Journal Limited.","","Australasia; Australia; climate change; planning practice; sustainability; urban society; urban system; urbanization","Consuming Australia: Main Findings, (2007); Athanasiou T., Justice within limits, (2007); Athanasiou T., Baer P., Kartha S., Greenhouse development rights, EcoEquity and Christian Aid, (2006); Inquiry Into Australia's Future Oil Supply and Alternative Transport Fuels: Final Report, (2007); Indicator: HS-37 energy use per capita and per unit of GDP, Data Reporting System, (2006); Christoff P., Low N., Recent Australian urban policy and the environment: Green or mean?, Consuming Cities, pp. 241-264, (2000); Coelho D., Ruth M., Seeking a unified urban systems theory, Fourth International Conference on the Sustainable City, (2006); Davison A., Stuck in a cul-de-sac?

Resisting floods by means of levees, dams, and channelization neglects inherent uncertainties arising from human-nature couplings and fails to address the extreme events that are expected to increase with climate change, and is thereby not a reliable approach to long-term flood safety. By applying resilience theory to address system persistence through changes, I develop a theory on ""urban resilience to floods"" as an alternative framework for urban flood hazard management. Urban resilience to floods is defined as a city's capacity to tolerate flooding and to reorganize should physical damage and socioeconomic disruption occur, so as to prevent deaths and injuries and maintain current socioeconomic identity. It derives from living with periodic floods as learning opportunities to prepare the city for extreme ones. The theory of urban resilience to floods challenges the conventional wisdom that cities cannot live without flood control, which in effect erodes resilience. To operationalize the theory for planning practice, a surrogate measure-the percent floodable area-is developed for assessing urban resilience to floods. To enable natural floodplain functions to build urban resilience to floods, flood adaptation is advocated in order to replace flood control for mitigating flood hazards. © 2012 by the author(s).","Flood adaptation; Flood control; Flood hazard management; Resilience surrogate; Resilience-based management; Resilient cities; Urban floodplains; Urban resilience","adaptive management; flood control; floodplain; hazard management; mitigation; planning practice; planning theory; urban area","Adger W.N., Social and ecological resilience: Are they related?, Progress in Human Geography, 24, 3, pp. 347-364, (2000); Adger W.N., Vulnerability, Global Environmental Change, 16, pp. 268-281, (2006); Adger W.N., Hughes T.P., Folke C., Carpenter S.R., Rockstrom J., Social-ecological resilience to coastal disasters, Science, 309, pp. 1036-1039, (2005); Alberti M., Marzluff J.M., Ecological resilience in urban ecosystems: Linking urban patterns to human and ecological functions, Urban Ecosystems, 7, 3, pp. 241-265, (2004); Allen C.R., Gunderson L., Johnson A.R., The use of discontinuities and functional groups to assess relative resilience in complex systems, Ecosystems, 8; Alley R.B., Berntsen T., Bindoff N.L., Chen Z., Chidthaisong A., Friedlingstein P., Gregory J.M., Hegerl G.C., Heimann M., Hewitson B., Hoskins B.J., Joos F., Jouzel J., Kattsov V., Lohmann U., Manning M., Matsuno T., Molina M., Nicholls N., Overpeck J., Qin D., Raga G., Ramaswamy V., Ren J., Rusticucci M., Solomon S., Somerville R., Stocker T.F., Stott P.A., Stouffer R.J., Whetton P., Wood R.A., Wratt D., Summary for policymakers, Climate change 2007: The physical science basis.

The strategy specifically focuses on the requirements for mobilizing large amounts of capital for adaptation and other urban risk reduction above and beyond the amounts that will likely be mobilized through new international adaptation funds. The paper, based on a report published by ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability,(1) proposes a re-framing of the urban adaptation and disaster reduction challenge. The approach shifts the adaptation focus from risk reduction as a primary end in itself to a broader development focus on financing the performance of urban assets, areas and/or systems. This emphasis is elaborated through the concept of ""resilience"", an urban design and investment metric that measures the ability of urban areas and their individual assets to perform for users and their investors under a wide range of conditions. The paper argues that such a performance-oriented approach provides a business logic that can attract conventional, private investment flows to climate and disaster risk reduction measures and thereby ""mainstream"" them. © 2012 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).","adaptation; cities; financing; investment; performance; property; resilience; risk","capital flow; climate change; disaster management; finance; risk assessment; urban area; urban design","Abramovitz J., Worldwatch Paper, (2001); Brugmann J., Welcome to the Urban Revolution: How Cities are Changing the World, (2009); Brugmann J., Financing the Resilient City: A Demand-Driven Approach to Development, Disaster Reduction and Climate Adaptation - An ICLEI White Paper, (2011); Burton C., Et al., Building Resilient Communities: Risk Management and Response to Natural Disasters through Social Funds and Community-Driven Development Operations, (2009); Hoornweg D., Et al., Cities and Climate Change: An Urgent Agenda, (2010); Mileti D., Disasters by Design: A Reassessment of Natural Hazards in the United States, (1999); Moon K., Downes N., Rujner H., Storch H., Adaptation of the urban structure type approach for vulnerability assessment of climate change risks in Ho Chi Minh City, pp. 2-4, (2009); Neligan M., Australian flood loss could total US$ 20 billion: Aon, Thomson-Reuters, (2011); California has more than 99 per cent chance of a big earthquake within 30 years, report shows, (2008); Sipkin S.A., Filson J.R., Benz H.M., Wald D.J., Earle P.S., Advanced national seismic system delivers improved information, Eos Trans.

Today, improving their resilience, i.e. their capacity to recover rapidly after flooding, appears to be a real issue at stake in societies' sustainable development. Due to their organization in the form of subsystems , the multiple aspects of their functions and the dynamics that drive them, these urban territories must be considered as complex systems. Within these urban systems, technical networks are physical links between inhabitants and the actors involved, the symbolic links of belonging to the same community, to the same organized territory (Lacoste quoted by Dupuy, 1991). As supports and even objects of interactions between the different sub-systems in the urban system and with the outside environment, they supply, unify and irrigate all the constituent elements of urban territories. In this way, networks participate in organizing and regulating the system by being the vector of relations between its different constituent elements. ""Physically connecting the elements in the system unifies them and creates the network's operating conditions at the same time. In the same way, it makes a certain mode of operation and evolutions in the system possible"" (Dupuy, 1984). This strategic position makes networks extremely influent in the dynamics of maintaining the global urban system. In turn, they can be generators of incidents by interrupting flows or vectors in the propagation of unforeseen turns of events. Therefore, characterizing their resilience to flooding may prove to be interesting in for providing a better understanding of urban resilience. In this context, we have decided to work on the resilience of waste management networks. Because they raise essential questions on sanitation and public health and because they often have a strong visual and psychological impact, these networks appear to be real issues at stake in crisis management. After flooding, the volume of waste generated is often significant and of a different sort (mixed, even polluted wet waste). Faced with this situation, waste management poses a real problem. What should be done with this waste? How should it be collected? Where can it be stored? How should it be processed? Who is in charge? Providing answers to these questions is all the more strategic inasmuch as post&hyphen;flood waste is the visual sign of the catastrophe. As a result, cleaning up is populations' and local actors' first reflex in order to forget what has happened, but also in order to start up again as quickly as possible. Therefore, it would appear primordial to improve waste management networks' resilience to flooding (Beraud et al..., 2010). First and foremost, improving the resilience of an organization requires understanding the way it operates in order to identify what dysfunctions it may contain. A methodology needs to be developed for this purpose, capable of analyzing a waste management network's way of operation under normal and crisis conditions. In this way, risks and potential dangers resulting from the urban system being flooded can be identified and the means of prevention for improving the waste management network's resilience to flooding can be brought out. Choosing the right methodology is not an easy task. Numerous methods of risk analysis exist. For the most part they are of industrial origin. As a result, it is not always easy to use them for studying social systems such as urban technical networks, as these systems possess characteristics that differ considerably from industrial systems. ""Multiple responsibilities with regard to the design, build, operation and maintenance of networks, separated amongst numerous actors who do not regularly communicate together and share information"" are, for example, one of the particularities of risk control in an urban environment (Prost, in Blancher, 1998). As a result, the way in which networks operate may appear to be extremely complex: the diversity and involvement of actors, different scales and territories to be taken into account, the issues at stake concerning the public service mission, catastrophic consequences, that are immediate and those with important repercussions when they are interrupted, etc. This complexity makes it extremely difficult to model urban networks (Maiolini, 1992), whereas applying methods used in the world of industry requires that models are created beforehand. Therefore, there are real methodology stakes in play when transferring these methods from industrial engineering to urban engineering. This article will present the methodology set up followed by initial results.

New urban policies and planning practices are needed to avoid, remedy or mitigate the impacts of oil price rises and create urban resilience (Newman et al. 2009). Whilst the lack of scholarship around oil vulnerability is slowly beginning to be addressed within the Australian urban planning context, an emphasis on the links between urban governance and urban resilience is still largely marginalised despite its acknowledged central role in the quest of urban resilience. Our main point of departure is the re-conceptualisation of oil vulnerability as a planning and governance deficit within Australian cities.

We examine a promising new tool for promoting this linkage - the metaphor of ""cities of resilience."" To put this tool to best use, we indicate how metaphor fits with other conceptual tools in science. We then present the two opposing definitions of resilience from ecology, and give reasons why one is more appropriate for linking with design. Additional specific tools and insights that are emerging from, or being increasingly used in, ecology can further support the linkage with urban design. These include recognizing the role of spatial heterogeneity in both ecological and social functioning of urban areas, the integrating power of watersheds, social and ecological patch dynamics of cities, the utility of spatial mosaic models to capture function, the use of an integrated ""human ecosystem"" modeling framework, and the consequent perspective of metropolitan areas as integrated ecological-social systems. Three additional tools are related to the adaptability of people and human institutions. First is the recognition of a ""learning loop"" in metropolitan ecosystems in which people respond to and affect ecological change, the use of urban design as experiments whose ecological and social outcomes can be measured, and finally the potency of a dialog between professionals and citizens, communities, and institutions, to support both research and design. The metaphor of resilience, and its technical specifications, draw these diverse strands for linking ecology and planning together. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Though concern for integrating disaster risk management approaches into development planning has been expressed in various policy documents and studies, exact methods of such integration at the spatial level are still being deliberated. The concepts of quality of life (QoL) and disaster resiliency are closely linked and their interrelationship is understood from the definitions and concepts developed in different studies. A disaster can have a negative impact on QoL and resiliency for disaster can protect and maintain QoL. This study develops an approach for integrating disaster resiliency into QoL based on new urbanization models, which can be re-orientated towards achieving resiliency. The Quality of Life with Disaster Resiliency (QoLDR) index offers the integration of resiliency issues arising from the urbanization process as well as natural hazards. It also provides directions for altering urbanization and increases adaptability, which results in resilient urbanization. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Climate change; Development; Disaster resiliency; Quality of life; Resilient urbanization; Sustainable","","Bahadur A., Ibrahim M., Tanner T., The resilience renaissance?

It will argue that this approach has been enhanced by a new focus on resilience. The case study will use examples of the Ecocities project, green infrastructure and flood risk to show how a concern for resilience has emerged.

Since 2005, more than half of the world population lives in cities. It's estimated that in 30 years time, this figure will most likely reach 80%[1]. Cities are the ecosystems were humans mostly live. In a world threatened by economic crisis, depletion of natural and ecological resources, diminishing biodiversity and climate change, sustainability depends on resilience. Resilience theories study complex social-economical systems, originally natural ones such as forests, coral reefs or lakes. After disasters like hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans, or the Haitian earthquake, certain awareness about urban resilience has been raised.

Examples include the approaches to and understanding of conservation in the Asian region that tend to rely on total reconstruction or restoration to preserve monuments in the urban environment. This is underpinned by the belief in the importance of intangible values as opposed to tangible, the spiritual aspects of a site or place and the relationship between landscape and monument within the cultural landscape. There have been attempts to address these differences. Conservation guidelines such as the Nara Document on Authenticity and charters such as the Burra Charter provide flexibility in interpretations of cultural significance. However, the debate remains fractured and the solutions provided remain firmly within the Western/Euro-centric mechanistic reductionist worldview. This paper proposes and alternative theoretical framework to understanding and interpreting the process of urban regeneration in the Asian region by adopting the principles of resilience thinking. Resilience thinking engages in a transdisciplinary way the dynamic interconnections and interdependencies amongst the key systems of the urban environment. In summary, the work in the field of resilience thinking has made great gains in providing an understanding of the complex nature of social-ecological systems and how these could be better prepared to deal with disturbances and in the long term be sustainable. From the studies on urban resilience there is potential for an exciting opportunity to rethink our understanding of cultural built heritage and urban regeneration as a social-ecological system developing a more universal approach to its regeneration and ultimately its sustainability.","Adaptive cycles; Cultural built heriatge; Resilience thinking; Urban regeneration","","Agrawal O.P., An Asian view of conservation, Museum, 27, 4, pp. 157-160, (1975); The Burra Charter.

Action to help poor urban communities adapt to become more resilient to possible change must therefore be initiated, although to date attention has focused on mitigation rather than adaptation. This paper considers the physical and financial implications for urban areas of the potential impacts of climate variability and change on water resources, illustrated by examples from sub-Saharan Africa, which is likely to be one of the most vulnerable and most affected regions. Water management, which will be particularly affected by climate change, could provide an opportunity to initiate structured adaptation responses. Adaptation costs in the sub-Saharan urban water sector are estimated at between 10 and 20 per cent of current overseas development assistance to the region. This paper suggests that additional funding should be made available in terms of the ""polluter pays"" principle, and should be channelled through government budgets rather than ring-fenced climate funds. This would help ensure that ""climate proofing"" is mainstreamed and would be in keeping with current trends in overseas development assistance reflected in the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Adaptation; Aid effectiveness; Climate change; Dams; Hydrology; Sub-Saharan Africa; Water","Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; adaptation; aid; climate change; finance; urban area; urban development; urban planning; water management; water resource","Adger W.N., Huq S., Brown K., Conway D., Hulme M., Adaptation to climate change in the developing world, Progress in Development Studies, 3, 3, pp. 179-195, (2003); Bouwer Laurens M., Jeroen C., Aerts J., Financing climate change adaptation, Disasters, 30, 1, pp. 49-63, (2006); Camdessus M., ""Financing Water for All"", (2003); de Wit M., Stankiewicz J., Changes in surface water supply across Africa with predicted climate change, Science Express, (2006); Gagnon-Lebrun F., Agrawala S., ""Progress on Adaptation to Climate Change in Developed Countries: An Analysis of Broad Trends"", (2006); (2000); ""Setting the Stage for Change"", (2006); Grubb M., Climate change impacts, energy, and development, Annual World Bank Conference on Development Economics, (2006); Hewitson B., Engelbrecht F., Tadross M., Jack C., General conclusions on development of plausible climate change scenarios for Southern Africa, Climate Change and Water Resources in Southern Africa: Studies on Scenarios, Impacts, Vulnerabilities and Adaptation, pp. 75-79, (2005); ""Summary of Climate Changes and Likely Impacts on Water Resources"", (2001); Climate change 2001; impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, (2001); Summary for policymakers: The economic and social dimensions of climate change, (2001); Jansen A., Schulz C.E., ""Water Demand and the Urban Poor: A Study of the Factors Influencing Water Consumption Among Households in Cape Town, South Africa"", (2006); Lomborg B., The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World, (2001); Muller M., Living with climate: Can the water sector lead in building resilient societies?, Living With Climate Variability and Change: Understanding the Uncertainties and Managing the Risks, (2006); Muller M., Parish pump politics - The politics of water supply in South Africa, Progress in Development Studies, 7, 1, (2007); DAC Development Cooperation Report 2005, (2006); (2005); Schulze R.E., Case study 2: Potential impacts of shifts in hydroclimatic zone on design hydrology from small catchments in Southern Africa, Climate Change and Water Resources in Southern Africa: Studies on Scenarios, Impacts, Vulnerabilities and Adaptation, pp. 241-247, (2005); Schulze R.E., Adapting to climate change in the water resources sector in South Africa, Climate Change and Water Resources in Southern Africa: Studies on Scenarios, Impacts, Vulnerabilities and Adaptation, pp. 423-449, (2005); Stern N., Review of the Economics of Climate Change.

This paper is set broadly within the civil defence and emergency management literature and informed by recent work on community participation and social capital in the building of resilient cities. Work in this area indicates a need to recognise both the formal institutional response to the earthquakes as well as the substantive role communities play in their own recovery. The range of factors that facilitate or hinder community involvement also needs to be better understood. This paper interrogates the assumption that recovery agencies and officials are both willing and able to engage communities who are themselves willing and able to be engaged in accordance with recovery best practice. Case studies of three community groups - CanCERN, Greening the Rubble and Gap Filler - illustrate some of the difficulties associated with becoming a community during the disaster recovery phase. Based on my own observations and experiences, combined with data from approximately 50 in-depth interviews with Christchurch residents and representatives from community groups, the Christchurch City Council, the Earthquake Commission and so on, this paper outlines some practical strategies emerging communities may use in the early disaster recovery phase that then strengthens their ability to 'participate' in the recovery process. © The Author(s) 2011.","Community development; Community participation; Social capital; Urban resilience","","Agyeman J., Briony A., The role of civic environmentalism in the pursuit of sustainable communities, Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 46, 3, pp. 345-363, (2003); Aldrich D., Strong civil society as a double-edged sword: Siting trailers in Post-Katrina New Orleans, Political Research Quarterly September, 61, pp. 379-389, (2008); Aldrich D., The power of people: social capital's role in recovery from the 1995, Kobe earthquake Natural Hazards, 56, 3, pp. 595-611, (2011); Anderson M., Woodrow P., Rising From the Ashes: Development Strategies in Times of Disaster, (1998); Boettke P., Chamlee-Wright E., Gordon P., Ikeda T., Leeson P., Sobel R., The political, economic, and social aspects of Katrina, Southern Economic Journal, 74, 2, pp. 363-376, (2007); Burns D., Systemic Action Research, (2007); Chamberlain P., Vallance S., Perkins H., Dupuis A., Community commodified: Planning for a sense of community in residential subdivisions, (2010); Coghlan A., Recovery management in Australia: A community based approach, (2004); Clarke L., Worst-case thinking and official failure in Katrina, pp. 84-92, (2008); Cutter S., Barnes L., Berry M., A placebased model for understanding community resilience to natural disasters, Global EnvironmentalChange18(2008)598-606, 18, pp. 598-606, (2008); Etemadi F., The politics of engagement: Gains and challenges of the NGO coalition in Cebu City, Environment and Urbanization, 16, 1, pp. 79-94, (2004); Escobar A., The 'ontological turn' in social theory.

Resiliency is often discussed in conjunction with vulnerability, a measure of the adverse effects of a hazardous event on a system, the magnitude of which is influenced by the system's resiliency. Vulnerability is determined by risk-proximity or exposure to hazards, which affects the probability of adverse impact and is a robustness-measure of the system's ability to adapt to a wide range of possible future conditions, at little additional cost. The greatest challenges for urban water infrastructure design, planning and management lie in our limited ability to quantify potential future conditions. This paper explores the utility of the fuzzy set theory in the field of water resource systems reliability analysis and proposes three new fuzzy reliability measures: (i) a combined reliability-vulnerability index, (ii) a robustness index, and (iii) a resiliency index.","Fuzzy reliability; Fuzzy robustness; Fuzzy vulnerability; Large cities; Municipal water supply","Climate change; Disasters; Fuzzy sets; Health hazards; Municipal engineering; Probability; Risk assessment; Robustness (control systems); Urban planning; fuzzy mathematics; water management; water supply; Fuzzy reliability; Fuzzy robustness; Fuzzy vulnerability; Large cities; Water management; Water supply","Ang H.-S., Tang H., Probability Concepts in Engineering Planning and Design, (1984); Burn D.H., Venema H.D., Simonovic S.P., Risk-based performance criteria for real-time reservoir operation, Can.

Then, it may play an important role as a stimulus to increase the acceptability of several policy actions that aim to upgrade urban resilience. Despite the multiple dimensions of wellbeing, health is surely a key variable attracting everyone's attention, which is thus more likely to be able to persuade people that actions that may at first seem undesirable are fundamental in improving urban sustainability and well-being. Methods: After creating a short list of socio-economic and environmental factors relating to the onset and aggravation of COPD, daily admissions distributions were compared using both a non-weighted and a weighted multi-criteria hierarchical analysis procedure. Results: Porto's COPD Social and Environmental Inequalities Index (SEII), calculated with a hierarchical analysis procedure, accurately illustrates a great relationship between COPD admissions and adverse urban form variables. Conclusion: COPD may be an important communication tool to stimulate the acceptability of some otherwise unpopular planning measures to improve urban resilience (sustainability and well-being). © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","COPD; Multi-criteria hierarchical analysis; Social and environmental inequalities index (SEII); Urban form","Demography; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Humidity; Models, Theoretical; Portugal; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Social Environment; Socioeconomic Factors; Temperature; Urban Health; Urban Population; Porto [Porto (DST)]; Porto [Portugal]; Portugal; Sustainable development; Communication tools; COPD; Environmental factors; Hierarchical analysis; Key variables; Multi-criteria; Multiple dimensions; Planning measures; Policy actions; Social and environmental inequalities index (SEII); Socio-economics; Urban form; Urban resilience; Urban sustainability; Wellbeing; accuracy assessment; disease severity; environmental factor; hierarchical system; morbidity; multicriteria analysis; planning process; respiratory disease; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; urban planning; article; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; ecosystem resilience; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental sustainability; hospital admission; human; Portugal; priority journal; Social and Environmental Inequalities Index; socioeconomics; statistical analysis; urban area; wellbeing; Pulmonary diseases","Adda J., Chandola T., Marmot M., Commentary - Socio-economic status and health: causality and pathways, J Econometrics, 112, 1, pp. 57-63, (2003); Standards for the diagnosis and care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 152, (1995); Bobak M., Contribution of socioeconomic and psychosocial environment.

Design/methodology/approach – A case study approach is utilized combined with field observation, participatory observation and a general literature review of relevant studies and secondary sources. Findings – The major finding is that the unique device of 85 tsunami height poles was brought from the outside to Banda Aceh city so that people may remember the impact of the tsunami over a longer period of time when awareness is likely to reduce. As local people gradually understood the significance of the poles, the number of local cooperators increased and the project's impact improved significantly. Research limitations/implications – The longterm impact of the disaster resilience is yet to be verified in Banda Aceh city. The field research results of the project's process and impact immediately connected with grassroots practice with people to maintain disaster awareness and resilence for the city. The practice to which the Hyogo Framework for Action gives priority connects with building understanding of tsunami risk and disaster awareness with local knowledge, assimilated by preserving disaster records and visualizing disaster. Practical implications – The paper describes a fieldbased project in Banda Aceh city and the suburb, Indonesia, which was implemented in cooperation with local communities, local nongovernment organizations, local school boards and specialists from Kyoto University, Japan. Thus, the study findings are directly related to its practical implications. Originality/value – The paper highlights how the device of 85 tsunami height poles which were built in order to visualize disaster and maintain disaster awareness under the concept, blended an expert's unique idea with old Japanese knowledge in Banda Aceh city by the local community in Indonesia in June 2007. The paper shows that local ideas maintain living knowledge and lessons with sustainable development in the local place after the project had finished and recommendations can apply to the other tsunami affected areas. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Disasters; Education; Indonesia; Tidal waves","","Doocy S., Rofi A., Moodie C., Spring E., Bradley S., Burnham G., Robinson C., Tsunami mortality in Aceh Province, Indonesia, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 85, pp. 273-278, (2007); Hatori T., Religious monuments of the Genroku tsunami in 1703 at Kujukuri hama, Chiba prefecture, Journal of Physics of the Earth, 2, pp. 98-101, (1975); Hatori T., Monuments of the tsunami of 1703 and 1923 in the south Kanto district, Bulletin of the Earthquake Research Institute, 50, pp. 385-395, (1975); Hatori T., Monuments of the 1703 Genroku Tsunami along the South Boso Peninsula: wave height of the 1703 tsunami and its comparison with the 1923 Kanto Tsunami, Bulletin of the Earthquake Research Institute, 51, pp. 63-81, (1976); Hatori T., Monuments of the Nankaido tsunamis of 1605, 1707 and 1854 in the Shikoku District: behavior of historical tsunamis and their comparison with the 1946 Nankaido Tsunami, Bulletin of the Earthquake Research Institute, 53, pp. 423-445, (1978); Hatori T., Behaviors of the Kanto tsunamis of 1677 and 1703 along Kujyukurihama: from the field investigation of old monuments, Bulletin of the Earthquake Research Institute, 54, pp. 343-350, (1979); Iemura H., Takahashi Y., Pradono M., Sukamdo P., Kurniawan R., Earthquake and tsunami questionnaires in Banda Aceh and surrounding areas, Disaster Prevention and Management, 15, pp. 21-30, (2006); Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters, (2005); Kitahara I., Tsunami monument in three eastern north prefectures, Japan, Tsunami Engineering Technical Report, No. 18, pp. 85-92, (2001); Oie T., Koshimura S., Yanagisawa H., Imamura F., Analysis and damage assessment of tsunami affected Banda Aceh city, Japan Society Civil Engineers Coastal Engineering Journal, 53, pp. 221-225, (2006); Recovery Aceh-Nias Database I., (2005); Shuto H., Monuments of the 1933 Shouwa Sanrikuoki tsunami: circumstances of construction and meanings of disaster prevention, Tsunami Engineering Technical Report, No. 18, pp. 73-84, (2001); World Disasters Report 2004 Focus on Community Resilience, (2005)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78349240647"

We further addressed the way in which technological developments, especially linked to the advancement of CCTV, became embedded within a powerful rhetoric of the ‘fortress city’ where security became a strongpoint of sale. © 2009, Jon Coaffee, David Murakami Wood and Peter Rogers.","Blast Resistance; Crime Prevention; Private Security; Terrorist Attack; Terrorist Threat","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144737461"

This paper deals with the concept of urban seismic vulnerability, and introduces resilience, as the capacity of a system to adapt itself to new, generally negative, conditions, in order to re-establish normal conditions. Each city can express resilience, and the identification of its elements is the goal of our research.

Although there is some disagreement among these different literatures about how to define and measure resilience, there is broad consensus that: (1) cities must become resilient to a wider range of shocks and stresses in order to be prepared for climate change; and (2) efforts to foster climate change resilience must be bundled with efforts to promote urban development and sustainability. Emerging issues for future study highlight some of the challenges associated with practical application of resilience approaches. These include responding to equity concerns associated with uneven patterns of resilience both within and across cities, assessing the costs of implementing resilience strategies, and identifying options for harnessing the innovation potential in cities as a means to foster resilience and sustainability. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","","climate change; cost-benefit analysis; equity; literature review; strategic approach; sustainability; urban development","Pelling M., The Vulnerability of Cities: Natural Disasters and Social Resilience, (2003); Boyd E., Osbahr H., Ericksen P., Tompkins E., Lemos M., Miller F., Resilience and 'climatizing' development: examples and policy implications, Development, 51, pp. 390-396, (2008); Sperling F., Valdivia C., Quiroz R., Valdivia R., Angulo L., Seimon A., Noble I., Transitioning to Climate Resilient Development Perspectives from Communities in Peru.
