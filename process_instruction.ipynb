individual preferences, has a long history  in the study of residential decisionmaking processes. residential choice behaviour, however, is often  the result of a group decisionmaking process. in this paper we investigate whether conjoint preference  models derived from group responses are different from and predict better than conventional con  joint models derived from the responses of individuals who do not interact during the datacollection process. in particular, we propose a new approach to modelling group preferences for  residential choice alternatives that extends previous work of timmermans et al. the new approach  is illustrated in an application among 193 families with children. the results confirm that preference  structures of individual family members differ from group preference structures and that the  proposed group based model predicts family preferences for new residential environments better  than do conventional models.  1 introduction  the analysis and modelling of residential preferences continues to be a widely researched  topic in urban planning. this interest reflects the concern of urban planning to study the  relationship between environmental characteristics and people s behaviour. from an  applied perspective, the increasing market orientation of the housing sector has led to a  clear need for a better understanding of residential preferences of various socioeconomic  segments.  an examination of the relevant literature suggests that researchers have typically  examined individual residential preferences . for households consisting of more than  one person, this practice thus assumes that individuals can provide valid and reliable  responses that represent the preferences of the family as a whole. surprisingly, this  assumption goes largely untested in the residential choice literature.  the aim of this paper is twofold. first, we wish to test the hypothesis that responses  obtained from individual family members predict family preferences equally as well as  responses collected from the family as a whole. second, because we expect to reject this  hypothesis, we propose an improved modelling approach for modelling group responses.  to this end, the paper is organised as follows. first, we shall develop and explain the  new, alternative modelling approach. then, we present the application, focusing on the  design strategy and measurement procedures, followed by a discussion of the results of  the analyses. the paper will be concluded with a summary of the main findings.  2 model development  2.1 hierarchical information integration  to understand the contribution of this paper to the literature, it is important first to  discuss hierarchical information integration theory and its application to group  decisionmaking. hii is an extension of information integration theory to model complex decision problems. it has been developed to allow the inclusion  of a larger number of attributes in conjoint tasks . hii assumes that, if subjects have to evaluate a  complex choice alternative involving many influential attributes, they first group or  categorise the attributes into separate higher order decision constructs, form evalu  ations for these decision constructs separately, and then integrate their evaluations of  the decision constructs to form a final, overall preference for the complex choice  alternative. thus, hii is a theory of how individuals reduce information overload. in  addition, however, it also represents a modelling approach in that tasks constructed  to measure preferences strictly follow theory. thus, separate designs are constructed to  measure individual preference for decision constructs, and in addition a bridging  experiment is designed to measure how individuals arrive at an overall preference or  choice by integrating their ratings for the decision constructs.  timmermans et al proposed an extension of this approach in order to model  multiperson decisionmaking. they assumed that individual family members first inde  pendently evaluate each decision construct as is assumed in hii. these construct  evaluations of individual family members are then assumed to be integrated by the  family to arrive at a family preference or choice. thus, in theoretical terms, they added  the group aspect to conventional hii. their approach meant that designs were con  structed to measure the family members preferences for higher order decision constructs  and a bridging experiment was conducted to measure how families arrive at an overall  preference or choice by integrating the family member ratings for the decision constructs.  despite their encouraging results, this approach has some potential limitations.  first, it shares the limitations expressed about hii, on which it is based . in particular, the bridging experiment may encourage respondents to use  simplifying heuristics in providing overall preference judgments  because the profiles in the bridging experiment consist only of numerical preference  ratings for the decision constructs. the underlying attributes are not explicitly men  tioned. second, as attribute effects are tested across only a limited range of values, there  is no control over respondents inferences about the values of other decision constructs.  third, the approach results in separate submodels rather  than in a single integrated model. fourth, the assumed hierarchical decision structure  cannot be tested, but rather one must assume that the hierarchical structure is correct to  concatenate the results of the separate experiments into an overall model of residential  preference.  a second limitation of the approach is its limited opportunity for group interactions  to take place. the procedure measures individuals preferences before any group inter  action the interaction between the spouses serves only to measure the influence of each  spouse on the final group outcome. group interactions may, however, lead to preference  changes as a result of information and normative processes . the approach we propose in the next section allows for all such processes by  simulating the group decisionmaking process.  2.2 a group model based on integrated hii experiments  in light of the above discussion, the goal of the present project was to develop an  approach for modelling group preferences which overcomes these shortcomings. the  particular approach that we suggest in this paper is to construct so called integrated  subexperiments rather than conventional hii experiments, and to ask groups to complete all experimental tasks jointly rather than using a mixture of  individuals and groups to complete different tasks. the use of integrated subexperiments  avoids the objections raised against hii. these experiments create profiles, which vary group based versus individual based models  not only the attribute levels of the decision construct of interest, but also the construct  evaluations of all other decision constructs. consequently, the bridging experiment is no  longer required. the specific advantage of this modification is, first, that profiles  describe all dimensions relevant to the decision problem under investigation. hence,  respondents no longer have to infer values of missing dimensions. dimensions are  described either as hypothetical preference ratings or as profiles of attribute subsets.  second, the approach allows one to test the validity of the assumed hierarchical decision  structure . third, data on the dependent variable of  interest can be directly collected in each subexperiment, regardless of whether the  researcher s interest focuses on ratings or choice data. each subexperiment is a separate  and independent conjoint experiment that can be analysed accordingly, even if the  hierarchical structure should prove not to be valid.  the advantages of an approach based on integrated subexperiments also seems  pertinent to the modelling of group preferences. in the present study, therefore, we  explore these and potential other advantages of this design strategy to the modelling of  group preferences. in particular, we suggest adding individualised construct evalu  ations of the remaining decision constructs to the profiles in each subexperiment, as  shown in figure 1 for the case of two decision constructs.  subexperiment 1 by joint group  figure 1. experimental tasks of the proposed multiperson model. the shading indicates what is  varied in the experiment.  thus, we propose a model that includes parameters for the attributes belonging to  a particular decision construct and, separately for each family member, parameters  for the other constructs. these parameters can be interpreted as the relative influences  of the family members on the joint decision. note that individual family members can  complete tasks identical in nature to these group tasks. in that case, the construct  parameters can be interpreted as the extent to which the family member takes into  account the preferences of his or her family members.  the model can be formally described as follows  kek. nen  where vtj is the utility of alternative j as measured in subexperiment the xijk are  the appropriately coded levels for attributes k, k ki9 kt being the attribute subset  varied in subexperiment i the gi jn are the coded levels of the remaining constructs  i for group member n, n e n, tv being the set of group members the f ik and xvn  are the corresponding unknown parameters for subexperiment and stj is an error term.  in the alternative approach suggested here, all tasks are completed by all group  members in interaction. hence, the responses are collected through a simulated group  decisionmaking process. during this process, individual group members may reveal  their preferences, attempt to influence other group members, change their preferences  as a result of discussions with other group members, and finally reach a joint decision.  as the estimated preference function is based on group decisions, the effects of group  interaction are automatically incorporated in the model. therefore, we hypothesise that subexperiment 2 by joint group 1938 e molin, h oppewal, h timmermans  this suggested alternative modelling approach will lead to potentially more valid models  of group preference than will conventional models based on tasks completed by indi  vidual group members.  in the next section we present an application of this alternative approach to  modelling residential preferences. in this application, we will illustrate the suggested  approach and test the hypothesis that models based on group responses outperform  models that are estimated from responses of individual group members, even if  these models are combined according to some averaging function.  3 methodology  the substantive problem of interest concerns residential preferences of families, con  sisting of at least a father, a mother, and a child. the application of the suggested  alternative modelling approach involves the following steps identification of the  attributes assumed to influence the formation of residential preferences, including the  categorisation of these attributes into decision constructs and the choice of attribute  levels, the construction of a design with integrated subexperiments, the selection  of respondents, the choice of a measurement procedure, and the estimation of  the model and the interpretation of the estimated parameters. details of these steps  will be provided in the following . a further classification of these constructs in terms of decision sequences is  not made here as our approach assumes a simultaneous choice process. the selected  attributes and their levels are listed in table 1. the hypothetical construct evaluations  table 1. the selected attributes and their levels.  housing location  housing type

associated labels marginally sufficient  and good , respectively. these numerical figures correspond with typical grades given in  the dutch school system, the 5 suggesting that the evaluation is marginally sufficient.  3.2 design construction  having selected the attributes and their levels, the next step involved the construction  of the design with integrated subexperiments. because two decision constructs were  identified, two such designs need to be constructed, one for the house and one for the  location construct. attribute profiles for the house construct were created by using an  orthogonal fraction of the 4 x 32 x 25 factorial design involving 16 treatments. the  choice of an orthogonal fraction implies that unbiased estimates of the attribute effects  can be obtained. in the case of the location subexperiment, an orthogonal fraction of  the 33 x 25 factorial, also involving 16 treatments, was created. an example profile of the  house subexperiment is provided in table 2. three random orders of profiles were used  to avoid any order effects. families were randomly assigned to one of these order  conditions. within a family, the order was held constant between the various tasks.  table 2. example profile of the house subexperiment.  house apartment  rent  4 bedrooms  bedroom child 16 m2  monthly costs dfl 1000  location evaluation of location by father good  evaluation of location by mother marginally sufficient  evaluation of location by the children good  in addition to the profiles used for model estimation, two sets of hold out profiles   were created for validation, using a different selection and  ordering of the columns from the experimental design plans that were used for the con  struction of the experimental profiles. thus, a second set of 16 profiles was constructed  for the house subexperiment format and a second set of 16 profiles was constructed for  the location subexperiment format. these profiles were randomly paired for each  subexperiment, under the constraint that no alternative dominated any other in the  resulting choice sets. each family received two randomly selected hold outs profiles  and one randomly selected choice set.  3.3 subjects and measurement procedure  participants were 193 families of eindhoven, the netherlands, each family consisting  of a father, mother, and at least one child older than 13. the families were recruited  through the children s school or their previous participation in a study on consumer  products. after receiving an introductory letter by mail, they were contacted by an  interviewer who made an appointment for them to complete one of the following tasks   an individual task in which family members individually, without discussion or  interaction with any other family member, completed a conjoint task. they expressed  their preferences for each of the profiles on a 21 category rating scale, with the  extremes labelled as very unattractive and very attractive .   a family task in which family members jointly responded to both subexperiments,  using the same response scale as the one used in the individual task. to provide these  responses, family members had to discuss the profiles and solve possible preference  disagreements. 1940 e molin, h oppewal, h timmermans  families were randomly assigned to one of these tasks. after one to two weeks, a  second session was organised. as indicated in table 3, families who already had  completed an individual task either again received an individual task or a family task.  families who completed a family task in the first session again received a family task  in the second session. note that the replications of the experimental tasks at t2 were  included to allow an assessment of the reliability of the models. these reliability  analyses are, however, beyond the scope of this paper.  after another two weeks, all families participated in the family hold out task in  which family members were asked to express their joint preferences for two hold out  profiles on a rating scale and select the alternative they liked best from another pair of  hold out profiles. all these tasks were supervised by an interviewer. before completing  the experimental tasks, respondents familiarised themselves with the attributes and  constructs varied in the experiment by rating six attribute profiles which were not  part of the experimental design.  table 3. research design.  experimental time of measurement  conditional  tx conjoint task 1 t2 conjoint task 2 t3 hold out task0  1 individual tasks individual

attrition between t2 and t3.  4 analysis and results  central in this study is the hypothesis that conjoint models of residential preference  based on group responses advance our understanding of residential preferences and  outperform models derived from individual responses. the central hypothesis was  tested in two ways. we first tested whether the model estimates derived from families  joint responses are significantly different from model estimates based on the individual  or averaged responses of individual family members. second, we tested whether the  model derived from family responses better predicts preference judgments, expressed  for hold out choice alternatives. before presenting the results of these tests, we shall  first discuss the parameter estimates, in particular with respect to their interpretation  in terms of the influence of individual family members on the outcome of the family  decision. this discussion will demonstrate how the proposed approach potentially group based versus individual based models 1941  advances our understanding of residential preferences as none of the conventional  approaches allows these kinds of interpretation.  4.1 attribute effects  we started our analysis by estimating atlnodel for each familyand eacht individual  family member father, mother, child . for each family, we also estimated a model  by averaging the responses of individual family members, further referred to as an  equal weight model. assuming that a simple main effects only model is able to repre  sent a family s residential preferences, multiple regression analysis was used to estimate  these preference models. the dependent variable in these analyses is the overall profile  rating the independent variables are the effect coded attribute levels. consequently, the  estimated regression coefficients represent the part worth utilities of the attribute levels  expressed as deviations from the regression intercepts, which are equal to the mean  overall profile evaluations. the equal weight model was estimated from the profile  ratings after averaging the profile ratings of the individual family members.  the results obtained from these analyses indicate that the simple main effects only  model fits the observed preference ratings for the experimental residential profiles quite  well table 4 shows that the mean proportion explained variance is higher than 0.90 for  all models. tables 5 and 6 present the average part worth utilities for the  house and location subexperiments, as estimated for the various models.  table 4. goodness of fit of estimated models proportion explained variance of observed profile  ratings by estimated models.  house subexperiment location subexperiment  mean

may be interpreted as  follows. the part worth utilities estimated for the housing type indicate that utility  increases with the housing type becoming more detached. the part worth utility is  relatively low for apartments and, to lesser extent, also for row houses. semidetached  and detached dwellings are preferred, and the difference in utility between these two  categories is relatively small. utility increases almost perfectly linearly with an increas  ing number of bedrooms and with larger bedrooms for children. owner occupied  dwellings are preferred over rented dwellings. utility increases with decreasing monthly  costs, and this relationship is almost perfectly linear.  the estimated part worth utilities for the location attributes may be interpreted as  follows.

0.47  9.86  72  examination of table 5 thus suggests that children have most influence on a family s  preference rating for the location construct, as indicated by the range of the part worth  utilities of a particular attribute or construct. this perhaps unexpected result is, however,  corroborated by the estimates for the location attributes, derived from family responses,  listed in table 6, which shows that the family as a whole finds travel time to school more  important than travel time to work. this seems consistent with the common knowledge  that families are reluctant to move during the children s high school years. moreover, as  illustrated by the estimated models for the parents, both parents are more influenced by  their children s preferences than by their spouses preferences.  a further observation from table 6 is that the fathers have the highest influence  with respect to the family s preference rating for the house construct. one may find  this an unexpected result, arguing that mothers often spend more time at home and thus have a higher interest in a good housing  situation. however, as suggested by the theory of relative resources , fathers may indeed have more to say about family resources, which  should in part be spent to cover residential costs, as they contribute most to the family  income. in 95 of our sampled families the father earned more than the other family  members.  such analyses about the influence of family members can be extended to the  attribute level. table 6 indicates that all family members attach most importance to  those travel times that affect them most. thus, fathers weigh travel times to their work  more than the travel time to work of their spouse or travel time to school. there is also  evidence of power relations. mothers take the travel time to work for fathers more into  consideration than vice versa. the evaluation of the house by mothers plays a lesser role  in the evaluation by fathers than vice versa. mothers, on average, apparently also take group based versus individual based models 1943  table 6. preference structures estimated from the location subexperiment.  family

to have most power and are less inclined, on average,  to incorporate the value judgments of their spouse and children. similar effects can be  observed in table 5.  4.3 comparing preference structures  to investigate whether the estimated preference structure of the various models differ  significantly, we tested for differential regressions between models. to that effect, the  observations were pooled and codes, representing contrasts between models, were added  to the design matrix. first, a model was estimated without the contrast parameters as  explanatory variables, and then the model was reestimated by including the contrast  parameters. a partial f test was applied to test whether the set of contrast parameters  contributes significantly to the explained variance. this test statistic can be expressed  as follows   change q r2  and follows a f qn p distribution. change represents the additionally explained variance  due to the contrast parameters, n is the total number of observations in the pooled  samples, p is the total number of parameters, and q is the number of contrast parameters.  if the i hange value is significant, one can proceed by examining the values of the  contrast parameters to identify which attributes are responsible for the differences  between the two models. 1944 e molin, h oppewal, h timmermans  table 7. values calculated  family

observations, p total number of parameters, q number of contrast  parameters, p vahie level of significance.  the results of the i tests presented in table 7 show that, across families, the family  model is significantly different from the individual member models and also from the  equal weight model. that is, the preferences of fathers, mothers, and children as  measured in the individual tasks are all significantly different from the family prefer  ences expressed in the joint family tasks. moreover, family preferences are different  from averaged individual preferences, indicating that preference differences between  family members do not balance out at the aggregate level. these results thus confirm  our assumption that group interactions play a role in the joint family task. individual  family members may exert a different influence on the outcome of the group decision  and members may change their preferences as a result of informational and normative  processes .  it is interesting to look at which attributes are responsible for the differences  between fathers, mothers, and children. tables 5 and 6 present the part worth utilities  estimated for the house and location subexperiments for the family as such and each  family member separately. if a contrast parameter is significant ,  then the corresponding part worth utility is marked with an asterisk. hence, these  tables indicate which of the estimated part worth utilities of the family members model  and equal weight model differ significantly from the family model. table 5 illustrates that  fathers evaluate apartments significantly lower than children do. in fact, children appear  to have a significantly different preference function for most housing type attributes.  although the preference ordering is the same for fathers, mothers, and children, children  differentiate less between extremes, suggesting they care less about housing type.  as for the number of bedrooms, fathers discriminate least, mothers most. in con  trast, children weigh the monthly costs less, whereas this is an important attribute for  fathers. a similar result is obtained for tenure. children in general have provided higher  evaluation scores. the individual evaluations of location are significantly different as  indicated earlier.  table 6 demonstrates that fathers and mothers care more about the kind of neigh  bourhood. as expected and discussed in connection with power relations, there is  evidence of significant differences in the evaluation of the travel time attributes.  thus, it can be concluded that such comparisons shed interesting light on the power  relationships within families.  4.4 predictive ability  a corollary to the central hypothesis in the present study was that family models  outperform family member and equal weight models in predicting family preferences  and choices for new residential alternatives. in this study, new residential alternatives  were represented by family ratings for hold out profiles and family choices between group based versus individual based models 1945  pairs of hold out profiles, as observed about two weeks after the second task .  table 8 shows how the predictions of the family member, equal weight and family  models differ from the observed family ratings for the constructebl hold out profiles of  residential environments. it shows that the mean absolute difference is significantly  smaller for the family models than for family member and equal weight models, at the  95 probability level.  table 9 presents the percentage of correctly predicted choices of the family member,  equal weight, and family models. it shows that the proportion of correctly predicted  choices is larger for the family models than for the family member and equal weight  models. one sided mests indicate that the differences between the family model and the  family member model for the choice of the location are significant at the 95 prob  ability level. the differences between the family model and the equal weight model are  significant at the 90 probability level. the differences for the house format choices are  not significant.  we thus find that model performance improves from individual measurement of  residential preferences to group measurement in the case of location attributes. this  could be a result of the conflict that is generated by the travel time attributes. no such  conflicts are apparent in the house subexperiment, which suggests that family models  outperform family member models in

preferences for complex  choice alternatives, such as residential environments. critical for the suggested approach  is that group members complete an experimental preference task in which choice alter  natives are described in terms of a set of relevant attributes, describing the choice  alternatives, and the preferences of other group members for the alternatives. the theory,  design strategy, measurement tasks, and model estimation of this alternative approach  have been developed in this paper and illustrated in the context of residential preferences  of families. this approach can help to improve our understanding of residential pref  erences as it not only allows a direct assessment of the effects of attributes, describing the  house and the location, on group preferences but in addition also gives insight into the  relative influence of individual group members on the outcome of the group decision  process and potential sources of conflict within groups. in this study, it was empirically  investigated whether the proposed conjoint preference model, derived from group  responses to experimental profile descriptions of residential environments, results in  different preference functions from those obtained in conventional conjoint preference  models, which are derived either from individual responses only, or from a combination  of individual responses. in addition, the hypothesis that group based models outperform  individual based models was examined.  the results of the present study confirm that preferences of different family members  differ from family preferences. consequently, common practice to select one family  member as a representative in housing surveys to provide responses that are supposed to  reflect family judgment is unlikely to result in valid and reliable measurements of  residential preferences. the results of the analyses confirm that the family model predicts  family preferences for new residential alternatives better than family member models,  again suggesting that our understanding of residential preferences can be improved if a  group based approach is used. furthermore, as for the prediction of choices as opposed  to preferences, this study suggests that the family model outperforms the family member  and equal weight models in predicting choices for new residential choice alternatives in  the location subexperiment, but not in the case of the house subexperiment. this may  suggest that the advantage of group based conjoint preference models is highest if there  exists a considerable degree of conflict or disagreement among family members in terms  of their preference for a particular attribute. it is not surprising that in these kinds of  cases our understanding of residential preferences may be significantly improved as  conventional individual based conjoint models do not allow one to draw any conclusions  about the influence of group members on the final outcome of the group decision  process. moreover, as there is no interaction between group members, the preference  ratings expressed by a single, representative group member are based on his or her  impression of the judgments of all other group members and will not change as a result of  interaction or discussion. thus, only if there is a high degree of agreement among the  preferences of group members, or at least highly monotonic relationships between  the preferences of group members, are conventional conjoint preference models likely  to predict well. in all other cases, they are likely to perform less well than group based  conjoint preference and choice models.  the extent to which particular attributes are indeed sources of conflict between  individual group members can be assessed by the proposed approach. in addition, it can  be used to measure the relative influence of individual group members on the outcome of  the group decision process. in the present study, we found that the influence of children  on the location decision was relatively high, suggesting that parents are reluctant to  move when their children are still strongly oriented on their immediate environment.  in addition, we found evidence of both fathers and mothers being more influenced by group based versus individual based models 1947  their children s judgments than by their spouses preferences. also, fathers seem to play  a dominant role in the preference formation for attributes of the house, which might  illustrate the relative resources theory.  in conclusion, then, we feel that the suggested approach has potential value in  measuring preferences for choice alternatives in situations where the decisions are in  principle made by a group rather than by an individual. further methodological and  applied research is needed, however, to appreciate better the potentials and limitations  of the suggested approach.  references'"

Based on the timeline, the works are then drawn as nodes at the respective position on the timeline and the works linked by quotations are connected to each other with edges. Furthermore, different components within the graph should be visibly separated from each other. From a graph-theoretical point of view, it is possible that the citation graph is not only represented by a single directed graph, but consists of several independent subgraphs. In the context of this work, however, it is useful to consider the citation graph always as a single unit and thus as **a graph with several components**. \n",

    "#### Summarised Citation Graph after Node Summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various approaches to summarizing graphs, but they are not necessarily applicable to such relatively small graphs like our citation graphs. A merging of several nodes to a supernode with superedges is a well realizable possibility. Several nodes with the same or very similar incoming and outgoing edges are merged into one large node. In order to minimize errors and to reconstruct the original graph exactly, the merge consists not only of the graph itself, but also of a list of corrections of the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can quickly become very inefficient for large graphs, since numerous comparisons of the nodes with each other must be processed to find those with similar edges. In [15] such an algorithm is presented, where first similar nodes are searched for to avoid unnecessary comparisons between all nodes. Then a summary of the graph is iteratively generated by merging original nodes or already existing supernodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of the citation graphs, only merges of nodes in the same level, i.e. publications with the same publication year, are reasonable. Because of this, supernodes with a large number of merges are extremely unlikely, so it makes more sense to focus on good merges of two or three nodes each. For this purpose, all possible candidates for the merging of two nodes are found first. Using a weight based on common and different edges for each pair of candidates, the best possible candidates are then selected. Based on these results, the calculation of connection components with three nodes from the candidate pairs is performed to determine good merges of three nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We present the above described example in Fig. 2b as a summary after merging nodes: A total of 5 nodes and 37 edges are removed."
